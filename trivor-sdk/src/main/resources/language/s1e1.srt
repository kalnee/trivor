1
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,054
Please, Luke.

2
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,889
How many cups
have you had this morning?

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,390
- None.
- Plus?

4
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,434
Five, but yours is better.

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,811
- You have a problem.
- Yes, I do.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,690
- Junkie.
- Angel.

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,859
You've got wings, baby.

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,655
Luke's. Yeah.

9
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,578
You make that look really good.

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,123
It is really good.
It's the best coffee in town.

11
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,834
- Yeah? I'll have to get a cup.
- Good plan.

12
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,377
I've never been here before.

13
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,255
Just passing through
on my way to Hartford.

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,591
You're a regular Jack Kerouac.

15
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,929
- Mind if I sit down?
- Actually, I'm meeting someone...

16
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,681
- I'm Joey.
- Okay.

17
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,225
You don't have a name?

18
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,853
I do have a name.
I just am really meeting someone.

19
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,105
So I guess I should get going.

20
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,690
- So soon?
- What?

21
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:50,610
I'm just screwing with your mind.
It's nice to meet you.

22
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,780
- Enjoy Hartford.
- Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.

23
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,908
I like that.

24
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:02,580
- Hey, it's freezing.
- What do you need? Hot tea, coffee?

25
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,956
Lip gloss.

26
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,211
I have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
and toasted marshmallow.

27
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,589
Anything in there
not resembling a breakfast cereal?

28
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:15,676
Yes. It has no smell,
but it changes colors with your mood.

29
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,054
- RuPaul doesn't need this much makeup.
- You're crabby.

30
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,224
I'm sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD,
and I need caffeine.

31
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,101
- I have your CD.
- Thief.

32
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,812
Sorry, and I will get you some coffee.

33
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,153
What? It's not for me.
It's for Rory, I swear.

34
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,363
- You're shameless.
- Look, Officer Krupke...

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,991
she's right at that table, right over there.

36
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:44,121
He's got quite a pair, this guy. Thanks.

37
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:48,876
- I've never been through here before.
- You have, too.

38
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,586
Hi.

39
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,464
- You really like my table, don't you?
- I was just...

40
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:55,716
Getting to know my daughter.

41
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,551
Are you my new daddy?

42
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:01,221
You don't look old enough
to have a daughter.

43
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,556
I mean it.

44
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,726
And you don't look like a daughter.

45
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,812
That's possibly very sweet of you. Thanks.

46
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:11,732
So, daughter.

47
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:17,195
- You know, I am traveling with a friend.
- She's 16.

48
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,364
- Bye.
- Drive safe.

49
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,399
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

50
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,569
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

51
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,156
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

52
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,116
We have a wedding party here.

53
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,244
No, there is really nothing I can do.

54
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:51,164
Yes, I'm sure. Positive.

55
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:55,585
No, I don't have to look, ma'am.
Yes, of course I'll look.

56
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,716
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

57
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,092
No, don't move.

58
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:06,846
Just ignore the tiny woman
pushing the 200-pound instrument around.

59
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:11,017
This is good. I like this.
Maybe after this I'll bench-press a piano.

60
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,686
That's it, lady. Tie your shoe now.

61
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,688
Don't worry. I'll wait.

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,107
- Hi, Drella.
- Hi.

63
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,278
I was just wondering,
could you be nicer to the guests?

64
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:25,573
I'm sorry. Did you not want a harp player?

65
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,534
- Yes, I did.
- Did you not want a great harp player?

66
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:33,581
- Yes, I did.
- I am a great harp player.

67
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,875
And this is my great harp, okay?

68
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,711
So if you just want someone
to be nice to the guests...

69
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,755
get a harmonica player.
Some guy who whistles through his nose.

70
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:44,049
Okay? Capisce?

71
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:48,137
And that is a great spot for a table.
The decorator's a genius.

72
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:52,016
Madame, you have no idea
how desperately I'd like to help...

73
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,643
but I'd have to build a room
for you myself...

74
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,854
and I'm not a man
who works with his hands.

75
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,022
So the best I can do is suggest...

76
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:02,651
that you please try for another weekend.
Any weekend.

77
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:08,448
Good. Fine. The 21st. Hold on, I'll look.

78
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,744
No, I'm sorry. We're completely booked.

79
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:20,877
- Has the plumber attended to Room 4 yet?
- He was here. He did nothing. It's $100.

80
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,008
Hi, Marco. Lorelai.

81
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:28,427
Talk to me about Room 4.
What was wrong with it?

82
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,306
I thought you replaced that already.

83
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,809
Because you told me you did.
I never forget anything.

84
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:37,644
So this one's on you, right?

85
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,105
Pleasure doing business with you.

86
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:43,358
- What is your offspring doing?
- I need stamps. Can I have these?

87
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,901
- No.
- Take them.

88
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,820
- What's with the muumuu?
- Stop.

89
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:50,407
You couldn't find one made of metal,
in case anyone has x-ray eyes?

90
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,242
And now we say goodbye.

91
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:55,120
Have Michel look at your French paper
before you go.

92
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,413
Excuse me?

93
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:57,914
- That would be great.
- No.

94
00:06:57,998 --> 00:07:01,543
Come on, Michel.
I'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are.

95
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:04,045
I believe that memo has already been sent.

96
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:05,338
Please, Michel.

97
00:07:05,422 --> 00:07:08,550
Pretty please with sucre on top?
I will stop talking like this.

98
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,553
Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a chance.

99
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:15,390
It's due tomorrow.
And pay special attention to the grammar.

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,687
I despise you.

101
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:31,197
When are you gonna let your parents know
that you listen to the evil rock music?

102
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,658
You're an American teenager,
for God's sake.

103
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,451
If my parents still get upset...

104
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:37,954
over the obscene portion size
of American food...

105
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:41,332
I seriously doubt I'm going to make
any inroads with Eminem.

106
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:44,877
- I have to go to that.
- The hayride? You're kidding.

107
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,922
My parents set me up
with the son of a business associate.

108
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,340
He's gonna be a doctor.

109
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,467
- How old is he?
- Sixteen.

110
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,220
So he's gonna be a doctor in 100 years.

111
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,264
My parents like to plan ahead.

112
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,184
- You have to go to the hayride with him?
- And his older brother.

113
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:04,063
- Now you're kidding.
- Koreans never joke about future doctors.

114
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,274
I guess you're not going?

115
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:10,111
No. I'm still fuzzy on what's fun
about sitting in the cold for two hours...

116
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:14,448
- with a bundle of sticks up your butt.
- Don't expect me to clear it up for you.

117
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:21,622
For those of you who have not finished
the final chapters of Huckleberry Finn...

118
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,791
you may use this time to do so.

119
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:27,294
For those of you who have,
you can start on your essay now.

120
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:30,548
Whichever task you choose, do it silently.

121
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:48,482
- Maybe it's a love letter.
- Or her diary.

122
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,442
Could be a slam book.

123
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,240
It's the assignment.

124
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,262
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

125
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,057
Tell it to the tip jar.

126
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,725
Take the bags up to 314.

127
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,395
Make sure the drapes are closed
and there's extra soap...

128
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,605
and she wants her pillow mints now.

129
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,485
- Sookie!
- I'm okay.

130
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:37,447
What did you do now?
Why weren't you watching her?

131
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,949
No estabas cuidandola?

132
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:42,452
No. She's this. Bad food in the head.

133
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,748
- I need you to be more careful.
- I know. I'm sorry.

134
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,708
I fixed the peach sauce.

135
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:51,545
- That's blood. Why are you bleeding?
- My stitches opened.

136
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:54,422
I was using too much maple syrup.
It strangled the fruit.

137
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:57,133
- When did you get stitches?
- Friday night. Radish roses.

138
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,343
Okay, stop moving.

139
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:01,221
You gotta taste the sauce
while it's still warm.

140
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:03,974
Sookie, I need you to be more careful.

141
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,893
I need there to be fewer accidents.

142
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:12,816
Dear God Almighty, that's incredible!

143
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,568
I'll put it on the waffles tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

144
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:18,238
- I wanna take a bath in that sauce.
- I will make more.

145
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,909
Someday when we open our own inn,
diabetics will line up to eat this sauce.

146
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:25,078
Won't that be great?

147
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:29,040
The key to someday achieving that dream
is for you to stay alive long enough...

148
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,417
so we can actually open an inn,
you understand?

149
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,753
- Yes, I understand.
- All right.

150
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,299
Now let's get you up and to the doctor
on three. One, two, three.

151
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,384
What?

152
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,762
Stepped on my thumb. I'm fine.
On three. Okay.

153
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,433
- Was it a good color, at least?
- It had sparkles in it.

154
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:51,187
And it smelled like bubble gum
when it dried.

155
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,648
There's no way Mark Twain
could compete with that.

156
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:57,902
Mom, we're home!

157
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,947
- Did you hear something?
- I'm not sure.

158
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,783
Mom, are you here?

159
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,160
We're open. Everything's half off.

160
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,829
We have contact.

161
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,747
- Mom!
- Lane?

162
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,752
Mom, where are you?

163
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,837
- Lane, where are you?
- Back here.

164
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,464
Over here.

165
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,676
I think she's that way.

166
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,845
- Are we closer?
- I'm by the table.

167
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,932
She's kidding, right?

168
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,059
Look, we'll meet you in the kitchen.

169
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,852
- What?
- The kitchen!

170
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,688
- Who's that?
- It's Rory, Mom.

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,818
I could hear the disappointment from here.

172
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,361
Come on. Stop it.

173
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:43,489
It sucks that after all these years
your mom still hates me.

174
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:46,075
- She doesn't hate you.
- She hates my mother.

175
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:49,286
- She doesn't trust unmarried women.
- You're unmarried.

176
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:52,706
I'm hayriding with a future proctologist.
I have potential.

177
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,294
Go upstairs. Tea is ready. I have muffins.
No dairy, no sugar, no wheat.

178
00:11:57,378 --> 00:12:00,339
You have to soak them in tea
to make them soft enough to bite...

179
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,882
but they're very healthy.

180
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:04,510
How was school?

181
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,720
None of the girls get pregnant, drop out?

182
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,555
Not that we know of.

183
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:11,767
Though come to think of it,
Joanna Posner was glowing a little.

184
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,269
- What?
- Nothing, Mama. She's just kidding.

185
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,773
- Boys don't like funny girls.
- Noted.

186
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,317
Hello! Anybody here?

187
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,277
We're here. We're coming.

188
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,655
Have the muffins
made from sprouted wheat.

189
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,240
Only good 24 hour.

190
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,783
Everything's half off!

191
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:29,534
- Where are you?
- Over here!

192
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,453
- Where?
- By the chair!

193
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:32,871
What chair?

194
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,749
- Careful!
- I'm okay.

195
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:36,875
Peppers.

196
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,251
Mike.

197
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:42,672
Hello, little vegetables.
Come with me. I got it.

198
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,925
- Where's my glaze?
- In the counter.

199
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,260
On the counter. On, not in the counter.

200
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,596
Okay, good. All right.

201
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,641
My sauce. That's pretty good.

202
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,269
Hello. A little bit of green. Okay.

203
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:59,940
Hello, my little babies. You like that?

204
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,650
A little bit of juice.

205
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,569
You're very pretty. Okay.

206
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:12,994
It's here. It happened. She did it.

207
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,788
I'm gonna need a longer sentence.

208
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:17,207
The Chilton School. Rory got in.

209
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:20,335
- Oh, my God!
- I know. Look.

210
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:24,005
'We are happy to inform you we have
a vacancy at Chilton Preparatory...

211
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,925
'starting immediately.
Due to Rory's excellent credentials...

212
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,260
'and your enthusiastic pursuit
of her enrolment... '

213
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,262
I offered to do the principal to get her in.

214
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:35,183
'... we'd be happy to accept her once
the first semester's tuition is received. '

215
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,101
This is very exciting.

216
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,981
- Is something burning?
- My bangs. Earlier. Go on.

217
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,193
She can finally go to Harvard
like she's always wanted...

218
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:48,613
get the education I never got,
and do all the things I never got to do.

219
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:49,989
Then I can resent her for it...

220
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:53,951
and we can finally have
a normal mother-daughter relationship.

221
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:55,912
Mom?

222
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,876
- You're happy.
- Yeah.

223
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,755
- Did you do something slutty?
- I'm not that happy.

224
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,925
Here.

225
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,010
- What's going on?
- Open it.

226
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:18,059
- I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
- You're going to Chilton! Sorry.

227
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,185
Mom?

228
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:21,854
You did it, babe. You got in.

229
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:26,150
How did this happen?
You didn't with the principal, did you?

230
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,735
No. That was a joke.

231
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,446
They have an open spot.
You're gonna start on Monday.

232
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,114
- Really?
- Really.

233
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:35,618
I don't believe this.
My God, I'm going to Chilton?

234
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:37,995
Sookie, I'm going to Chilton!

235
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,581
I'll make cookies.
Protestants love oatmeal.

236
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,416
I have to call Lane.

237
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,962
- I love you.
- I love you.

238
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,926
My girl's going to Chilton.

239
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,303
Yeah, I know. Rory's going to Chilton!

240
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,365
Michel, the phone.

241
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,659
It rings.

242
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,871
- Can you answer it?
- No.

243
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:25,125
People are particularly stupid today.
I can't talk to any more of them.

244
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:30,339
You know who's really nice to talk to?
The people at the unemployment agency.

245
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,635
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

246
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,430
No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.

247
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,893
I'm holding for Miss Bell.
I've been trying to get ahold of her all day.

248
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,770
Lorelai Gilmore.

249
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:49,107
Hi.

250
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:53,445
Yeah, my daughter Rory
has just been accepted.

251
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:55,614
Thank you.

252
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:58,909
And I got the invoice
for your enrolment fee.

253
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,412
That is a lot of zeroes behind that five.

254
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:07,959
Okay, I guess what I'm wondering is...

255
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:11,588
if you couldn't take, say, part of it now,
just to get her going?

256
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,011
But she's supposed to start Monday.

257
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,264
It just doesn't give me a lot of time
to pull a bank job.

258
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,434
Never mind. I was just kidding.

259
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,062
No, a bank job is robbing a bank, but...

260
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:36,488
No. I don't want you to give up her space.

261
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,782
I'll have to figure it out.

262
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,622
Okay. No, thank you.
It's been a real treat talking to you.

263
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,249
Yeah. Bye-bye.

264
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,345
What do I do?

265
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,264
You can have anything I own.
My car. Sell my car.

266
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,100
Sweetie, no one wants your car.

267
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,103
There's something I haven't thought of.

268
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:12,815
There's something out there staring me
right in the face. I haven't seen it.

269
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,651
- You might consider calling...
- No.

270
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,320
- But I don't think you have...
- Stop.

271
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,821
You can at least go and...

272
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:22,074
Okay, can I say one more thing?
I think it's your only option.

273
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:25,995
There are several chapters
from a Stephen King novel I'd reenact...

274
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,039
before I'd resort to that option.

275
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:30,666
- Okay, dropped.
- Thank you.

276
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,419
Mom, so what do you think?

277
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,296
It makes you look smart.

278
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:38,424
Okay, no more wine for you. Mom?

279
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,470
You look like you were swallowed
by a kilt.

280
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,096
Fine, you could hem it.

281
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,140
A little, only a little.

282
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:48,058
Okay. Or I could hem it a lot.

283
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,311
No, I don't want it to be too short.

284
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,147
I can't believe tomorrow's my last day
at Stars Hollow High.

285
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,273
I know.

286
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:57,109
- Today I was so excited, I dressed for gym.
- You're kidding!

287
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,112
- And I played volleyball.
- With other people?

288
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:03,032
And I learned all this time
I was avoiding group sports...

289
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,867
was very smart, because I suck at them.

290
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,493
You got that from me.

291
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,704
- Where's your pate?
- At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.

292
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,373
I'm going to the store,
because you have nothing.

293
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,543
- Do you feel like duck?
- Lf it's made with chicken, absolutely.

294
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,587
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

295
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,174
All right, this will give you an idea.

296
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,469
- Go see how you like it.
- Okay.

297
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,598
I love being a private school girl.

298
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,141
Hi, Mom.

299
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,728
Lorelai! My goodness, this is a surprise.

300
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,897
Is it Easter already?

301
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:21,484
No, I just finished up my business class,
and I thought I would stop by.

302
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,278
- To see me?
- Yes.

303
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,614
Isn't that nice.

304
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,325
- Come in.
- Thanks.

305
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,958
- The place looks great.
- It hasn't changed.

306
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,835
There you go.

307
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:43,465
How are the girls at the bridge club?

308
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:44,799
Old.

309
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,136
Good.

310
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,477
You said you were taking
a business class?

311
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,315
Yeah. I'm taking a business class
at the college twice a week.

312
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,649
I'm sure I told you.

313
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,193
If you're sure, then you must have.

314
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:10,616
- Would you like some tea?
- I would love some coffee.

315
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:13,661
- Emily, I'm home.
- We're in here.

316
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,580
Hi, Dad.

317
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,250
What is it, Christmas already?

318
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,461
Lorelai was taking a business class
at the college today...

319
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:24,505
and decided to drop in to see us.

320
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:25,882
What business class?

321
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:29,093
- She told us about it, dear. Remember?
- No.

322
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,890
Actually, I came here for a reason.

323
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,226
Dad, would you mind sitting down
for a minute?

324
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,854
- You need money.
- I have a situation.

325
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,816
- You need money.
- Dad, just please let me get this out, okay?

326
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,987
Rory has been accepted to Chilton.

327
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:52,116
Chilton? That's a wonderful school.

328
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,993
It's only five minutes from here.

329
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:57,496
That's right, it is.
She can start as early as Monday.

330
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:01,709
The problem is that they want me
to put down an enrolment fee...

331
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,669
plus the first semester's tuition.

332
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:06,797
I have to do that immediately
or she loses her spot.

333
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:09,091
So you need money.

334
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,468
Yeah.

335
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:15,639
But it's not for me, it's for Rory.

336
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:19,476
I intend to pay you back, every cent.
I don't ask for favors. You know that.

337
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:21,395
Yes, we know.

338
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,564
I'll get the checkbook.

339
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:28,026
Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.

340
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,863
- On one condition.
- So close.

341
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:34,116
Since we are now financially involved
in your life...

342
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:37,244
I want to be actively involved in your life.

343
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:41,039
What does that mean, Mother?

344
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:43,792
- I want a weekly dinner.
- What?

345
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:47,379
Friday nights, you and Rory
will have dinner here.

346
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:48,463
Mom.

347
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,966
And you have to call us once a week...

348
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:53,927
to give us an update
on her schooling and your life.

349
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,139
That's it. That's the condition.

350
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,808
If you agree,
you'll come to dinner tomorrow night...

351
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,143
and leave here with the check.

352
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:04,229
Otherwise, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

353
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:11,027
I don't want her to know
that I borrowed money from you.

354
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,613
Can that just be between us?

355
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:15,615
Does 7:00 work for you?

356
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:18,493
Perfect.

357
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,095
And we get to wear uniforms.

358
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:39,973
No more people checking you out
to see what you're wearing...

359
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:43,518
'cause everyone's dressed alike
in boring clothes, just there to learn.

360
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,604
Okay, there's academic-minded,
and then there's Amish.

361
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:48,481
- Funny.
- Thank you.

362
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:51,943
- I told my mom you're changing schools.
- Was she thrilled?

363
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:54,529
The party's on Friday. I got to go.

364
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:58,449
I have to have a pre-hayride cup of tea
with a future doctor.

365
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:00,785
- How do I look, Korean?
- Spitting image.

366
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:02,870
- Good. Bye.
- Bye.

367
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:12,630
God!

368
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:16,968
You're like Ruth Gordon,
just standing there with the tannis root.

369
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,971
- Make a noise.
- Rosemary's Baby.

370
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:28,062
- Yeah.
- That's a great movie.

371
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,857
You've got good taste.

372
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:34,277
Are you moving?

373
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:36,529
No, just my books are.

374
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:38,990
My family just moved here from Chicago.

375
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:43,411
Chicago. Windy. Oprah.

376
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,454
Yeah, that's the place.

377
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:47,999
I'm Dean.

378
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,542
Hi.

379
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:54,130
Rory. Me. That's me.

380
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:59,051
- Lorelai, technically.
- Lorelai. I like that.

381
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:01,929
It's my mother's name, too.
She named me after herself.

382
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:05,641
She was in the hospital thinking about
how men name boys after themselves...

383
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:08,394
so why couldn't women?
She says her feminism took over.

384
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:12,898
Personally, I think a lot of Demerol
also went into that decision.

385
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:15,192
I never talk this much.

386
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:17,778
I better go.

387
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:20,698
- Sure.
- I have to go look for a job.

388
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,199
Okay, good.

389
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:28,747
- You should check with Miss Patty.
- What?

390
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:31,333
About the job.
You should check with Miss Patty.

391
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:34,211
She teaches dance.
She was actually on Broadway once.

392
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:37,214
I don't really dance much.

393
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:40,801
No, she just knows everything
that's going on in town.

394
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:43,136
She'll know if someone's looking.

395
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,682
Great. Thanks.

396
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,314
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing much.

397
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:58,318
I should throw this away at some point.

398
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:01,488
Maybe you could show me
where this Miss Patty's place is.

399
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:05,200
Yeah, I guess so.
I really don't have anything important to...

400
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,035
Let's go.

401
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,296
- Have you lived here all your life?
- Yes. Pretty much.

402
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,132
- I was actually born in Hartford.
- That's not far.

403
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,343
- Thirty minutes with no traffic.
- Really?

404
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,470
- I timed it.
- Okay, then.

405
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,353
- Do you like cake?
- What?

406
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,273
They make really good cakes here.

407
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:39,651
They're very round.

408
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,570
Okay, I'll remember that.

409
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,823
Good. Make a note.

410
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:48,576
You wouldn't want to forget
where the round cakes are.

411
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,329
How are you liking Moby Dick?

412
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:53,164
- It's really good.
- Yeah?

413
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:55,667
- Yeah, it's my first Melville.
- Cool.

414
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:59,712
I know it's cliche to pick Moby Dick
as your first Melville, but...

415
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,591
How did you know
I was reading Moby Dick?

416
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,887
- I've been watching you.
- Watching me?

417
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:12,350
Not in a creepy I'm-watching-you
sort of way. I've noticed you.

418
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,352
- Me?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,062
When?

420
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:18,231
Every day.

421
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:23,027
After school, you come out
and sit under that tree, and you read.

422
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:26,614
Last week it was Madame Bovary.
This week it's Moby Dick.

423
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:30,409
- But why would you...
- Because you're nice to look at...

424
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,120
and because you've got
unbelievable concentration.

425
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:34,455
What?

426
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:36,707
Last Friday, two guys were tossing a ball...

427
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,918
and one guy nailed the other
right in the face.

428
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:41,504
It was a mess. Blood everywhere,
the nurse came out...

429
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:45,007
the place was in chaos,
his girlfriend was freaking out...

430
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:48,219
and you just sat there and read.
You never even looked up.

431
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:53,182
I thought, 'I've never seen anyone read
so intensely before in my entire life.

432
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,476
'I have to meet that girl. '

433
00:26:56,185 --> 00:27:00,356
Maybe I just didn't look up
because I'm unbelievably self-centered.

434
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,150
Maybe, but I doubt it.

435
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:09,865
- Did I ask you if you like cake?
- Yeah, you did.

436
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,411
'Cause they have
really good cake back there.

437
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,634
You were late getting home tonight.

438
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,220
Yeah, I went to the library.

439
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,934
We're having dinner
with the grandparents tomorrow night.

440
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,269
We are? But it's September.

441
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,272
- So?
- So what holiday is in September?

442
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,983
Look, it's not a holiday thing.
It's just dinner, okay?

443
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,527
Fine. Sorry.

444
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:53,992
Red meat can kill you. Enjoy.

445
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,792
I finished hemming your skirt today.

446
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,506
A grunt of acknowledgement
might be nice.

447
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,841
Why are we going to dinner
tomorrow night?

448
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,094
What if I had plans?
You didn't even ask me.

449
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,262
- Lf you had plans, I'd have known.
- How?

450
00:28:14,346 --> 00:28:15,722
You would've told me.

451
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,016
I don't tell you everything.
I have my own things.

452
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,228
- Fine, you have things.
- That's right. I have things.

453
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:24,648
- I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.
- Just tonight?

454
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,359
What the hell is wrong with you?

455
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:32,113
I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.

456
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,158
- What?
- The timing is just really bad.

457
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,285
The timing is bad?

458
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:40,956
And the bus ride to and from Hartford,
it's 30 minutes each way.

459
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,041
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

460
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,752
I don't think we should be spending
that money right now.

461
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:48,046
I know Chilton's
got to be costing you a lot.

462
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,964
You've no idea.

463
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,801
Your money should be going
into buying an inn with Sookie.

464
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:54,844
What about college? What about Harvard?

465
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:58,181
We don't know I can't get into Harvard
if I stay where I am.

466
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:00,600
Enough of the crazy talk, okay?

467
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:03,978
I appreciate your concern,
but I have this covered.

468
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,272
- I still don't want to go.
- Why?

469
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:09,317
- Because I don't.
- I have to get out of here.

470
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:15,198
We have to pay first.

471
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:47,355
One, two, three. It's a waltz, ladies.
Susie, do you have to tinkle?

472
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,190
Then uncross your legs, darling.

473
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:52,777
Rory, I think I found a job
for your male friend.

474
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,612
What male friend?

475
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,530
They need a stock boy at the supermarket.

476
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:58,658
I already talked
to Taylor Doose about him.

477
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,326
Just send him around tomorrow.

478
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,120
- Okay, thanks.
- What male friend?

479
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,665
He's very cute. You have good taste.

480
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,502
Hands in the air, not in the nose.

481
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,964
You'll have to walk faster than that.

482
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:17,259
You'll have to turn into frigging Flo Jo
to get away from me.

483
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,933
This is about a boy. Of course!

484
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:27,978
I can't believe I didn't see it.
All this talk about money and bus rides.

485
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,606
You've got a guy,
and you don't wanna leave school.

486
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:32,608
- I'm going to bed.
- God, I'm so dense.

487
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:35,861
It should've been my first thought.
After all, you're me.

488
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,238
- I'm not you.
- Really?

489
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:41,700
Someone ready to throw important
life experiences out to be with a guy?

490
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:44,286
- It sounds like me to me.
- Whatever.

491
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,246
- Who is he?
- There's no guy.

492
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,999
Dark hair, romantic eyes,
looks a little dangerous?

493
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:51,668
- This conversation's over.
- Tattoos are good, too.

494
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,338
I don't wanna change schools
because of all the reasons...

495
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,131
I've already told you a thousand times.

496
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:59,092
If you don't want to believe me,
that's fine. Goodnight.

497
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,719
Does he have a motorcycle?

498
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:04,640
If you're going to throw your life away,
he'd better have a motorcycle!

499
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:12,230
- I think that went pretty well, don't you?
- Thanks for the knock.

500
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:14,691
Listen, can we just start all over, okay?

501
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:19,196
You tell me all about the guy,
and I promise not to let my head explode.

502
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,657
Rory, please talk to me.

503
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:26,036
Okay, I'll talk.

504
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,163
Don't get me wrong, guys are great.

505
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,207
I am a huge fan of guys.

506
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,127
You don't get knocked up at 16
being indifferent to guys.

507
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:37,547
Babe, guys are always gonna be there.
This school isn't.

508
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,800
It's more important.
It has to be more important.

509
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:42,969
I'm going to sleep.

510
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,017
You've always been the sensible one
in this house.

511
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,603
I need you to remember that feeling now.

512
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:54,564
You will kick your own butt later
if you blow this.

513
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:57,067
- It's my butt.
- Good comeback.

514
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Rory, come on.

515
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:04,073
I don't want to talk about this.
Could you please just leave me alone?

516
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,869
Okay. Fine.

517
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:13,124
We've always had a democracy
in this house.

518
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,793
We never did anything
unless we both agreed.

519
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:19,339
But now I guess I'm gonna have to play
the mom card.

520
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:22,800
You are going to Chilton
whether you want to or not.

521
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:26,054
Monday morning, you will be there.
End of story.

522
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,182
- We'll see.
- Yeah, we will.

523
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,210
Okay. One, two...

524
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:03,341
- I swear I don't know what happened.
- It's not important.

525
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:06,385
I've made that dish a hundred times.
It never exploded.

526
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:10,014
- Please forget it.
- God, I killed a Viking.

527
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:13,601
You should fire me
or make me pay the cost of a new stove...

528
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:15,561
- out of my paycheck.
- Whatever you want.

529
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:18,189
I can't afford a new stove.
Those things are expensive.

530
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:21,817
Sookie, please, I am begging you,
pull yourself together.

531
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:25,196
I got no sleep last night, and I think
I put my contacts in backwards.

532
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:29,116
- Rory's still mad at you?
- I'm not so crazy about her, either.

533
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,744
It was a fight.
Mothers and daughters fight.

534
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,413
No, we don't fight. We never fight.

535
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:36,832
You told me to tell you
when your daughter arrived.

536
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:40,753
- She's here, and she's sitting in my chair.
- Hold on just a minute.

537
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,550
And you are the one left standing.

538
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,094
Life is a funny thing, no?

539
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,058
No muumuu today.
You know what's weird? I kind of miss it.

540
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,768
You left me a note to meet you here.

541
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:00,689
I thought you might want to work
a couple hours, make a little extra cash.

542
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,691
- Fine.
- You're not gonna give me...

543
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,027
the Mommie Dearest treatment forever,
are you?

544
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:08,614
You wanted me here, I'm here.
Should I do something or what?

545
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:12,159
Yeah, go home. Dinner's at 7:00.
Be ready to go.

546
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,077
- Fine.
- Fine.

547
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:20,417
My chair.

548
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,184
Do we go in or do we just stand here
reenacting The Little Match Girl?

549
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:43,940
Look, I know we're having a thing here,
and I know you hate me...

550
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:45,942
but be civil, at least through dinner...

551
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:49,112
and then on the way home
you can pull a Menendez. Deal?

552
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:50,488
Fine.

553
00:34:57,954 --> 00:35:00,373
- Hi, Grandma.
- You're right on time.

554
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,417
Yeah, no traffic at all.

555
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,797
I can't tell you what a treat it is
to have you girls here.

556
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,717
We're excited, too.

557
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:14,804
Is that a collector's cup,
or can I throw it away for you?

558
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,599
- In the kitchen, please.
- Sorry.

559
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:23,521
- I want to hear all about Chilton.
- I haven't actually started yet.

560
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,195
- Richard, look who's here.
- Rory.

561
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:35,199
- You're tall.
- I guess.

562
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,660
- What's your height?
- 5'7'.

563
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:41,122
- That's tall. She's tall.
- Hi, Dad.

564
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,209
- Lorelai, your daughter's tall.
- I know. It's freakish.

565
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:47,712
We're thinking of having her
studied at MIT.

566
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,507
- Champagne, anyone?
- That's fancy.

567
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,844
It's not every day
I have my girls here for dinner...

568
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,804
on a day the banks are open.

569
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,765
A toast: To Rory entering Chilton...

570
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,851
and an exciting new phase in her life.

571
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:03,728
Hear, hear.

572
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:06,856
Let's sit, everyone.

573
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,403
This is just wonderful.

574
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,782
An education is the most important thing
in the world, next to family.

575
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,117
And pie.

576
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,496
Joke.

577
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:44,101
- Rory, how do you like the lamb?
- It's good.

578
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:46,312
- Too dry?
- No, it's perfect.

579
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:49,857
The potatoes could use
a little salt, though.

580
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:51,358
Excuse me?

581
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,611
So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?

582
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:59,116
People die, we pay.
People crash cars, we pay.

583
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,370
- People lose a foot, we pay.
- At least you have your new slogan.

584
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:07,332
- How are things at the motel?
- The inn? They're great.

585
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:10,627
Lorelai's the executive manager now.
Isn't that wonderful?

586
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:13,380
Speaking of which,
Christopher called yesterday.

587
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,508
Speaking of which?
How is that a speaking of which?

588
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,385
He's doing very well in California.

589
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,637
His internet start-up
goes public next month.

590
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,974
This could mean big things for him.
Very talented man, your father.

591
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:27,102
- She knows.
- He always was a smart one, that boy.

592
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,521
You must take after him.

593
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:33,817
Speaking of which,
I'm going to get a Coke. Or a knife.

594
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,504
Hi, how are you doing?

595
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,679
- I think I'm going to go talk to her.
- No. I'll go.

596
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:05,724
You stay
and keep your grandfather company.

597
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:11,855
Lorelai, come back to the table.

598
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:14,065
Is it going to be like this
every Friday night?

599
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:16,151
I come over
and let the two of you attack me?

600
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,069
- You're being very dramatic.
- Dramatic?

601
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:20,446
- Were you at that table just now?
- Yes, I was.

602
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,866
You took what your father said
the wrong way.

603
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:25,451
The wrong way?
How could I have taken it the wrong way?

604
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:28,079
- What was open to interpretation?
- Keep your voice down.

605
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:31,624
No, Mother. I can't take it anymore.
Tonight has been like a nightmare.

606
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:34,335
You're dripping all over the floor.

607
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,462
Why do you pounce
on every single thing I say?

608
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:39,632
That's absurd.
You've barely uttered a word all night.

609
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:41,634
- That's not true.
- You said 'pie. '

610
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,970
- Come on.
- You did. All I heard you say was 'pie. '

611
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,556
Why bring up Christopher?
Was that really necessary?

612
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,016
- He likes Christopher.
- Isn't that interesting?

613
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:51,811
Because, as I remember,
when Christopher got me pregnant...

614
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,437
Dad didn't like him so much.

615
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:57,692
You were 16. What were we supposed
to do, throw you a party?

616
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:01,195
We were disappointed.
The two of you had such bright futures.

617
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:05,491
Yes. And by not getting married,
we got to keep those bright futures.

618
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,121
When you get pregnant, you get married.
A child needs a mother and a father.

619
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:13,624
Do you think Christopher
would have his own company now...

620
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,168
if we were married?
You think he'd be anything at all?

621
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,087
Yes, I do. Your father would've put him...

622
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,590
in the insurance business,
and you'd be living a lovely life right now.

623
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:23,884
He didn't want
to be in the insurance business.

624
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,679
And I am living a lovely life right now.

625
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,515
- That's right. Far away from us.
- Here we go.

626
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:32,810
You took that girl
and completely shut us out of your life.

627
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,646
- You wanted to control me.
- You were still a child.

628
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:38,732
I stopped being a child
the minute the strip turned pink, okay?

629
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:41,986
I had to figure out how to live.
I found a good job.

630
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,989
As a maid. With all your brains and talent.

631
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:47,574
I worked my way up. I run the place now.

632
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:50,703
I built a life on my own
with no help from anyone.

633
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:54,373
Yes, and think of where you would've been
if you'd accepted a little help.

634
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:56,375
And where Rory would have been?

635
00:39:56,417 --> 00:40:00,129
But no, you were always too proud
to accept anything from anyone.

636
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,465
I wasn't too proud to come here
to you two...

637
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,968
begging for money
for my kid's school, was I?

638
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:07,261
No, you certainly weren't.

639
00:40:07,344 --> 00:40:10,889
But you're too proud to let her know
where you got it from, aren't you?

640
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:15,644
Fine, you have your precious pride,
and I have my weekly dinners.

641
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,480
Isn't that nice? We both win.

642
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,501
Mom?

643
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:42,379
I'm okay. I just...

644
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,590
Do I look shorter? Because I feel shorter.

645
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,594
How about I buy you a cup of coffee?

646
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:58,186
You drive, though, 'cause I don't think
my feet will reach the pedals.

647
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:04,109
- Nice dinner at the grandparents' house.
- Yeah. Her dishes have never been cleaner.

648
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:06,903
You and Grandma
seemed to have a nice talk.

649
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:09,072
- How much did you hear?
- Not much.

650
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:10,198
Snippets.

651
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,242
- Little snippets.
- So basically everything?

652
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,994
- Basically, yes.
- The best-laid plans.

653
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,837
I think it was really brave of you
to ask them for money.

654
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:26,464
I so do not want to talk about it.

655
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:30,134
How many meals is it gonna take
till we're off the hook?

656
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,888
I think the deli spread
at my funeral will be the last one.

657
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,978
Wait, does that mean...

658
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,606
Can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt
go to waste.

659
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,275
Honey, you won't be sorry.

660
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:54,700
You look nice. Really nice.

661
00:41:56,661 --> 00:42:00,164
I had a meeting earlier at the bank.
They like collars.

662
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,625
You look nice, too.

663
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,503
I had a flagellation to go to.

664
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:09,507
- What'll you have?
- Coffee, in a vat.

665
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:14,011
I'll have coffee also. And chili fries.

666
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:17,640
That's quite a refined palate you got there.

667
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:24,021
Behold the healing powers of a bath.

668
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,734
Tell me about the guy.

669
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:32,029
You know what's really special
about our relationship?

670
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:34,740
The total understanding about the need
for one's privacy.

671
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:37,243
You really understand boundaries.

672
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,620
- So tell me about the guy.
- Mom!

673
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:42,581
- Is he dreamy?
- That's so Nick at Nite.

674
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:45,125
- I'm gonna find out anyway.
- Really? How?

675
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:47,127
I'll spy.

676
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:49,380
Coffee.

677
00:42:50,422 --> 00:42:51,715
Fries.

678
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:57,054
I can't stand it. This is so unhealthy.
Rory, please, put down that cup of coffee.

679
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,682
You do not want to grow up
to be like your mom.

680
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:01,350
Sorry. Too late.

681
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:11,777
- Tell me about the guy.
- Check, please.

682
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,780
- Are you embarrassed to bring him home?
- I'm not embarrassed.

683
00:43:14,863 --> 00:43:17,783
- Does he talk at all?
- No, Mom, he's a mime.
