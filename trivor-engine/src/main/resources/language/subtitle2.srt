00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,626
Previously, on
AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:04,994
We live.

3
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:06,496
We kill them all.

4
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,939
You wanna just come back with us?

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,909
Take a couple days before
you and Tara go out again?

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,879
I just wanna get outta here.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,680
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

8
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:27,316
When we leave from there...

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,393
It's gross. Just throw it back.

10
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,563
It'll dry out.

11
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:42,598
It smells terrible.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,900
We can empty it out,

13
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,035
stuff it full of Miss Iris' sage,

14
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:47,737
and some of the lavender, too.

15
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:48,971
Then what?

16
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,542
Then you have an awesome bear
that survived the stormy sea, Rachel.

17
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,411
I had one just like this
when I was your age, and...

18
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,047
Oh, shit! Look!

19
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,250
Don't run!

20
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,853
One hit.

21
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,889
I didn't have to twice.

22
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:09,224
Not bad, huh?

23
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,107
Yeah.

24
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,497
Look! Another one!

25
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:22,738
Come on. Don't run!

26
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:38,187
Wait!

27
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,229
She's not a bobber.

28
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,203
She's alive.

29
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,043
We still gotta do it.

30
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,611
No.

31
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:04,847
We don't have to do it.

32
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,450
Yes, we do.

33
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:12,654
No, we don't, not if
people don't find out.

34
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,727
We're supposed to.

35
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,362
I want to.

36
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:22,831
I don't.

37
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,633
So we won't.

38
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:29,438
Are you gonna tell?

39
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,444
Just tell me if you're gonna tell,

40
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,070
if you're a snitch.

41
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:38,213
I'm not a snitch.

42
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:41,450
But I'm not going to help.

44
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,220
Eight rusty cans of okra

45
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:09,589
and a bottle of aspirin.

46
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:15,995
That's what we got to show
for our time out here...

47
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,500
other than the fact that
we're still standin'.

48
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,668
Rule number one of scavenging...

49
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,905
There's nothing left in
this world that isn't hidden.

50
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,607
We just have to find it.

51
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,008
Good.

52
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,411
We just have to find it.

53
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:35,448
For a second there,
I was worried.

54
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,786
Listen, we went farther
than we were supposed to.

55
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,269
There's nothing left out here.

56
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,526
We don't even have
enough gas to keep looking

57
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,428
even if we wanted to, okay?

58
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,463
We said we'd be gone for two weeks.

59
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,998
It's been two weeks.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,967
As long as the Hilltop keeps
their side of the bargain,

61
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,735
we have food at home.

62
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,537
We need ammo.

63
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,806
We need medicine.

64
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,642
We can't go back like this.

65
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:04,244
There's people counting on us.

66
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,346
Why you acting like you don't know that?

67
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,150
I'm not sure that means
much to me anymore.

68
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:14,554
What we did at the satellite station...

69
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,758
all of those people that we killed...

70
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,228
You didn't see it, okay?

71
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,097
You just saw what was left.

72
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,565
No.

73
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,301
I had to do it, too.

74
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,703
Yeah, we all had to...

75
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,540
for some milk and some corn.

76
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,642
That wasn't the only reason.

77
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,876
And yeah, we did.

78
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,111
You know we did.

79
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,246
See, that's... That's the thing.

80
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,617
You saw how we were living back
home before you guys got there.

81
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,610
We didn't know shit.

82
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,621
We thought...

83
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,526
What?

84
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:53,126
- What?
- It doesn't matter.

85
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,653
I get it now.

86
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:04,537
If it's you or someone
else, you choose you.

87
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,608
You take what you can, you
take out who you have to,

88
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,611
and you get to keep going.

89
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,416
Nobody's in this together, okay?

90
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,819
Not anymore.

91
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,621
Hey.

92
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:25,458
It only hurts because you know what
you just said is total bullshit.

93
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,961
That's not you, Heath.

94
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:30,430
Tara...

95
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,172
that's me...

96
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,107
that's you...

97
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,846
and that's everybody
who wants to stay alive.

98
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,685
That's the truth.

99
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:57,690
We can push towards the
shore, but after today...

100
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,845
we go back.

101
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:04,430
Even if we just have those rusty cans.

102
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,197
No, I got it. Thanks.

103
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,799
Did they find
anything out there yesterday?

104
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,401
Ev said she reached the mouth.

105
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,636
Are you serious?

106
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,938
- What'd she see?
- Nothing.

107
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,240
All the way down there.

108
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,742
Not a damn thing.

109
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,381
Go ahead.

110
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:54,333
Doesn't matter.

111
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,969
We're supposed to.

112
00:14:56,971 --> 00:15:00,339
Rachel... no.

113
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,187
Hi.

114
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,624
I just... I didn't mean to.

115
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,487
Look, I'm cool.

116
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,698
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

117
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,166
Rachel...

118
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,469
everyone, just lower your guns.

119
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,104
Cyndie, get away from her!

120
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,340
She hasn't done anything wrong.

121
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:36,208
That has nothing to do with it.

122
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,476
Get away!

123
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:45,050
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,686
I just walked in... Crawled.

125
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,222
I didn't even know I was in.

126
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,391
I'm sorry.

127
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,627
I can just go.

128
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,635
Okay.

129
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:05,204
This is cool, too.

130
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:08,574
We just keep doing this.

131
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,773
What do we think?

132
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:47,213
Lotta blind spots down there.

133
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,058
Let's check behind the tarps first.

134
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:22,675
Looks like they had plans for something.

135
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:26,112
Looks like they didn't get to finish.

136
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,119
It's heavy.

137
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,488
Could be something good in there.

138
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,028
Tara.

139
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,830
Hold on. Hold on!

140
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,302
That way! Go!

141
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:32,078
- Heath!
- Tara!

142
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,231
Heath!

143
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,558
We just need to
hear what she has to say.

144
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,361
No. The longer we wait,
the more our community's at risk.

145
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:51,964
We agreed to discuss this together
as a group if someone ever got in.

146
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,933
We made that decision a long time ago.

147
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,174
Do you, need to use the
bathroom before we get started?

148
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,248
No.

149
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,917
Thank you.

150
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,387
But maybe...

151
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,791
I'm Natania.

152
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:23,963
This is Kathy and Beatrice,
whom you've already met.

153
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,147
Am I the only one hearing bells?

154
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:30,669
They're ours. We have six of them...

155
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,372
Some nearby, some a
couple of miles away.

156
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,141
What about the air horn?

157
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,410
We could only find so many bells.

158
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,812
They are to redirect any of the dead

159
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:43,783
that might have been drawn by it.

160
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,152
Not bad.

161
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,421
It helps sometimes.

162
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,856
But a branch in the
wind, leaves rustling...

163
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:54,193
We're lucky this is a
relatively clear area.

164
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:56,629
The evacuations, the barges...

165
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,098
If they were even real.

166
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,633
So...

167
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:04,403
where are you from?

168
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,705
Atlanta...

169
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,421
a long time ago.

170
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,445
I just stayed on the move.

171
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,848
My friend and I... We've
been traveling around

172
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,551
on our own for a couple years now.

173
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,220
We used to work on a fishing boat.

174
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:22,855
There's someone with you?

175
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,390
There was.

176
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,125
We got separated.

177
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:30,296
What kind of fishing
boat did you work on...

178
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:32,865
Trawler, seiner, larder?

179
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,901
Oh, last one. You got it.

180
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,639
What were you doing here?

181
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:43,209
You must understand, we get nervous

182
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,479
when people just find
their way into our home.

183
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,482
Yeah, I-I saw that.

184
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:52,397
My friend and I... We found this
settlement built on a bridge,

185
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,220
or what was left of it.

186
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:57,543
We were scavenging, and we got
attacked by walkers... the dead.

187
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,593
We were trying to get away from them,

188
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,661
and I got knocked off a bridge.

189
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:05,364
I fought the current,
wound up in the inlet.

190
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:07,700
The estuary?

191
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,102
The bay?

192
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:11,904
Look, I'm not good with geography.

193
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:15,341
I just thought I was dead out there.

194
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:17,376
And I got to the shore,
and I just passed out.

195
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,911
It's the bridge on Windsor.

196
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:20,679
You... you know how to get there?

197
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,914
We do.

198
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,449
She didn't answer the question.

199
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:24,683
I didn't?

200
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,051
What was the question?

201
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,720
What were you doing here?

202
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,355
When that girl, Cyndie, brought me food,

203
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:32,024
I just pretended like I was
out and I followed her back.

204
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,592
It seemed like she had a camp,

205
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,361
and I wanted to see if
I could get any help.

206
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:37,530
Then why were you sneaking around?

207
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:40,866
I wanted to see if it was safe.

208
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:42,535
Still not sure.

209
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,071
Look, I'm sorry that I freaked you out.

210
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,640
Really.

211
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,408
But if you just point me in
the right direction, I'm gone.

212
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,045
I need to get back to the
bridge and look for my friend.

213
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,215
If we let you go, you
have us at a disadvantage.

214
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,684
You know a great deal about us now.

215
00:22:58,686 --> 00:22:59,952
If you let me go?

216
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:01,554
Yes.

217
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:05,257
You see, normally, we
would've killed you already.

218
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,228
We shoot strangers on sight
if they come into our camp.

219
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,530
But Beatrice said you spared your life,

220
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:15,367
and my granddaughter almost
lost hers trying to save you...

221
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,403
"that girl," Cyndie.

222
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:21,307
So it leaves us with the question still

223
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,543
of what to do with you instead.

224
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:26,645
Yeah.

225
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:29,509
That's a pickle, all right.

226
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,752
Why don't you rest up?

227
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:35,120
We'll talk more later.

228
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,623
Maybe one of us will have a brainstorm.

229
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,995
Cool.

230
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,828
Hope you like fish.

231
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,824
The dried kind?

232
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:56,413
She brought you salted perch.

233
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,238
Did you like it?

234
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,739
Sure.

235
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,641
No, you didn't.

236
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,711
Not so much.

237
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,846
We're having stew.

238
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,183
Oh, that's right...

239
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:13,485
You two haven't formally met, have you?

240
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,654
Tara, this is Cyndie.

241
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,156
Hey.

242
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:19,558
Thank you for the beach and...

243
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,026
everything out there.

244
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,035
I mean, you saved my life.

245
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:28,133
You did.

246
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:30,703
I mean, I don't know if your
grandma totally approves, but...

247
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:35,007
My mom would've.

248
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,844
She showed me the way.

249
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:40,279
A way.

250
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,348
I was trying to show Rachel.

251
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,084
The little girl?

252
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,452
Yeah.

253
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,648
She hasn't had to do it yet.

254
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,291
Have you?

255
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,233
I'm a really good shot.

256
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:03,802
Yes, you are.

257
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,537
Okay, let's eat.

258
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,473
Let's talk.

259
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,932
Tara.

260
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,359
When was the last time you ate?

261
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:26,445
Do soy-sauce packets count as food?

262
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:29,139
We have an endless
supply of fish here...

263
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:32,675
One of the perks of living
so close to the ocean.

264
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:34,744
You... you think, Tara,

265
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,547
it's something you could get used to?

266
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:40,250
I'm hoping to convince you to stay.

267
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:41,885
Wait. What?

268
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,386
Why not?

269
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:46,089
It would be the perfect
solution to our problem.

270
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:47,924
We keep our village a secret,

271
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:50,160
and you'd get to put down roots.

272
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:53,329
You're a skilled fighter,
Tara, and a good person.

273
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:55,165
I can tell that.

274
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,433
You wouldn't be leaving anything behind.

275
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,203
And if you want, we can
help you find your friend.

276
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:03,072
And if he wants to stay,
we'll offer him a home, too.

277
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:04,774
He could stay here?

278
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:07,343
Is there a reason why not?

279
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:08,945
I mean...

280
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,749
well, I never thought
I'd be asking this,

281
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,784
but where are all the men?

282
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:24,302
All of them?

283
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:28,965
We got into a
skirmish with another group.

284
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:32,035
None of them made it.

285
00:27:32,037 --> 00:27:34,938
And we lost others, too.

286
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:40,043
Cyndie had an 11-year-old
brother, my grandson,

287
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,946
and their mother, too, my daughter.

288
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:53,790
After that, we decided to
protect ourselves, no matter what.

289
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:57,961
No matter who we crossed,
we would kill on sight.

290
00:27:57,963 --> 00:28:02,665
We left our old home with
just the clothes on our backs.

291
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:06,236
And then we found this place.

292
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,638
We would stay hidden.

293
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:16,946
And we would stay alive.

294
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:19,983
Tara, you could have
hurt us, and you didn't.

295
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:22,786
I-I know we must sound
like monsters to you,

296
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:26,810
but I had to be honest so maybe
you could understand why we do it.

297
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:29,592
Maybe you could...

298
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,261
consider staying.

299
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:34,330
And maybe you could be honest with us

300
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,266
about where you're from.

301
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:38,167
I was telling you the truth.

302
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:39,535
Really?

303
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:42,472
You said you worked on
a fishing boat, a larder.

304
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:43,806
That's right.

305
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,477
Tara, a larder is a room
used for storing meat.

306
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:49,612
Yeah. I was lying.

307
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,392
I come from a community.

308
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,827
And that's really what it is.

309
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,964
We live with each other.
We help each other.

310
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:09,465
We have walls, houses.

311
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:13,303
I have a girlfriend
I want to get back to.

312
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,271
And we've done things...

313
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:18,007
just like you.

314
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:23,880
There were these people.

315
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:25,448
They were threatening us.

316
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:30,394
We found out they were using an old
satellite station to operate out of.

317
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:32,985
We went out there in the
middle of the night, and we...

318
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:37,260
took them out, every one of them.

319
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:41,898
These people got what they deserved.

320
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,701
They chose to kill and
to terrorize people,

321
00:29:44,703 --> 00:29:47,337
but that's not why we killed them.

322
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,339
We didn't do it to make
the world a better place.

323
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:53,242
We did it because we wanted
to stay alive, just like you.

324
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:56,245
And I know that you
think that me staying

325
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,780
is the only solution.

326
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,415
Well, how's this for brainstorming...

327
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,317
Maybe our groups can
start working together.

328
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,387
We just told you that we don't want
anyone to know about this place.

329
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:06,556
You can't live like that forever.

330
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,091
I think we can.

331
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:11,163
Look, I ... I
get why you're doing it,

332
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:12,528
but if you keep seeing
everyone as an enemy,

333
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,130
then enemies are all you're gonna find.

334
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:17,233
Sooner or later, you're
gonna need a friend.

335
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:20,136
We can protect each other.

336
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:22,739
We'd be safer than we are...

337
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:32,482
All right.

338
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:35,952
We could send a guide out with her.

339
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,155
Help her look for her friend,

340
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:43,025
and then continue on to their community,

341
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:46,429
just... just to see what it's like.

342
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,466
Yeah, I'll do it.

343
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:52,243
I want to go with her.

344
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,302
Absolutely not.

345
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:55,505
You left without leaving a routing plan,

346
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,306
without signing with the gate.

347
00:30:57,308 --> 00:31:00,076
Cyndie, I thought we were
through with all this.

348
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:01,098
We are.

349
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:04,981
You will be staying behind the fence
until you learn some responsibility.

350
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:10,153
If this works out, there will
be plenty of other chances.

351
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:11,988
And if it doesn't...

352
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,123
I don't want you there.

353
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:19,162
There will be other chances.

354
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,836
Are you sure there isn't a
fishing boat called a larder?

355
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:28,370
'Cause I'm, like, pretty sure that...

356
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,505
- There isn't.
- Yeah. Fair enough.

357
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:36,543
This is gonna get better...

358
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,044
People getting together.

359
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,966
That's how the world is
gonna be the world again.

360
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,216
I hope you're right.

361
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,484
Be safe.

362
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,253
Where's Cyndie?

363
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:48,894
She's in the cabin, sulking.

364
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:52,659
We wouldn't be doing this if
it wasn't for her breaking all the rules.

365
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:57,598
Good luck, Tara.

366
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,233
Yeah.

367
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:04,504
You know, we'll...
We'll work on that, Natania.

368
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,772
Thank you.

369
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:07,240
See you soon.

370
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:25,692
See you later, Rachel.

371
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,187
Hey, Beatrice.

372
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:55,923
I'm sorry about the hit.

373
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:58,292
Well, you got lucky.

374
00:32:58,294 --> 00:32:59,693
Yeah, I did.

375
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,830
How far are we to the bridge?

376
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:04,932
About halfway there.

377
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:08,177
Stick close. It's pretty
thick through here.

378
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,798
I got it.

379
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,252
Please.

380
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:12,825
I could have killed
you back in the village.

381
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:14,694
Let me go.

382
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,597
You don't have anything left.

383
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,532
Your people are dead.

384
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,369
The Saviors.

385
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,339
That satellite post you took out...

386
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:29,309
You have no idea what you started.

387
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,843
We didn't start anything.

388
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,645
We ended it. They're dead.

389
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,514
You didn't stop them.

390
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,683
You can't stop them.

391
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:39,519
That was just an outpost.

392
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:43,089
There are more... More Saviors...

393
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:45,572
more outposts.

394
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:48,394
If they know about your friends...

395
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,731
it's already too late for them.

396
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:54,500
The Saviors...

397
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,137
they did this to you?

398
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,473
They're the ones that
killed all your men?

399
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,678
Every man...

400
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:08,810
every boy over 10.

401
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:12,494
They lined 'em up, shot 'em in the head.

402
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,490
You see, we tried to fight...

403
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:20,093
just like you.

404
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,028
They won.

405
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,331
And we were supposed to
keep working for them.

406
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:29,269
Then one night, we just left.

407
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,704
We got away, okay?

408
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,740
We are not gonna let
you lead them back to us.

409
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:38,111
They get what they want.

410
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:44,172
I'm sorry you didn't get...

411
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:46,919
Go! Run!

412
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:13,146
Wait!

413
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:24,857
You're not gonna shoot me.

414
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,492
Because I saved you?

415
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,927
Three times now.

416
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:30,163
You're not gonna shoot me.

417
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,967
You have to swear...

418
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:37,236
that you'll never come back

419
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:40,006
and you'll never tell anyone about us,

420
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,974
not even your own people.

421
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,738
Why... would I come back?

422
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:53,186
Why would I tell
anyone about this place?

423
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,922
Because maybe you could
get something out of it...

424
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:58,825
Anything.

425
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:02,195
Why did we kill those two
people who just came near us?

426
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,066
Why did you kill all those people

427
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,168
at that satellite station?

428
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,005
Because you all thought you had to.

429
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,977
But none of you had to.

430
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,012
You just did.

431
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,517
Nobody's evil.

432
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,622
They just decide to forget who they are.

433
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:35,762
You have to swear.

434
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,664
Some people are evil, Cyndie.

435
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:47,140
I've seen it.

436
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,509
That's why I have to get back now.

437
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,400
You have to swear.

438
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,090
I swear.

439
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,532
Here.

440
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:14,734
Food and water.

441
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:16,235
C'mon.

442
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,491
I'll take you to the bridge.

443
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:20,873
Try not to fall off this time.

444
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,125
There's more, right?

445
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:34,193
Yeah, a lot.

446
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:37,023
I'll use the cars as cover
until I can't anymore.

447
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,293
Then what?

448
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:40,272
I'll run.

449
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:42,067
I love to run.

450
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,302
It's my favorite thing.

451
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:46,805
You'll never make it.

452
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,540
Yeah, I will.

453
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:51,043
Let me help you.

454
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,811
You already did. You got me here.

455
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:55,080
Just go back. Tell them
that I attacked you.

456
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:56,614
They know you, Tara.

457
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,016
No, tell them you killed me.

458
00:39:58,018 --> 00:39:59,484
They know me.

459
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:01,219
You know I'm not going anywhere

460
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:05,223
until you get to the other side... safe.

461
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:09,027
I've got my rifle. I've got ammo.

462
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:13,231
I didn't get you here
just to watch you die.

463
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:17,035
So let's just get this over with, okay?

464
00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:21,873
Kathy and Beatrice... They
know we were coming here.

465
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,942
They're coming.

466
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,746
Okay.

467
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:32,751
Why aren't you like the rest of them,

468
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:36,488
after everything that's happened?

469
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:42,193
Why aren't you?

470
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,825
Okay.

471
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay, up on that side.

472
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:51,930
Go!

473
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:52,390
Heath!

474
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:53,731
Heath!

475
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:55,484
Heath!

476
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,846
Heath, I'm coming!

477
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:16,247
I'm coming!

478
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,651
No! Go! Go!

479
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:22,187
We're in this together!

480
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:24,055
I know.

481
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,340
Maybe that was you.

482
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,816
I hope that was you.

483
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:05,192
I'm sorry, Tara.

484
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:10,841
I'm sorry, too.

485
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:18,606
We don't have to just sit here.

486
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:24,679
Guns, ammunition...

487
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:27,749
you don't have any leads?

488
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:35,190
Anything, anywhere.

489
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:37,325
I don't care how dangerous it looked.

490
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,160
Tell me a place.

491
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:41,096
I'll go.

492
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:46,735
There's gotta be somewhere.

493
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:51,172
We can square this.

494
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:55,910
We can make this right.

495
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:58,747
We have to.

496
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:04,119
We can't.

497
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:09,557
I didn't see anything
like that out there.
