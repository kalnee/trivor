1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,358
Collins working on King here,
top of the key--

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,338
dribbling around him,
coming around the corner there, he's up!

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,841
Two points! Beautiful play.

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,877
Now, that's a great play.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,413
If you testify, no one can protect you,

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,415
especially the feds.

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,883
- We'll keep you safe, Joey.
- Right. In Witness Protection.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,715
This great new life he's giving you?

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,654
You're sackin' groceries
at some goat-town Stop and Shop,

10
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,954
when one of Vitale's guys comes
and puts two in the back of your skull.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,758
Counselor, are you advising a witness
to withhold evidence
from a federal grand jury?

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,764
He came forward.
He volunteered.

13
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,598
I'm advising him not to testify
until I'm satisfied you can protect him.

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,331
Hey, you guys mind?
I got money on this.

15
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,806
What do you want?
We gave you everything you asked for.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,208
- I asked for pasta.
- You got steak. Enjoy it.

17
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,715
- What are you doin'?
- What?

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,586
Where's your quit candy?
I just gave you a pack.
Yeah, sorry.

19
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,487
I forgot.

20
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,491
Joey, whatever they give us,

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,494
what they tell you,
you get popped,
what am I gonna do, sue them?

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,564
That's not what this is about.

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,759
You're gonna miss me.

24
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,167
- I'm your lawyer, Joey.
- You're my brother.

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,806
And I do this-- you know,
I go into Witness Protection--

26
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,002
we're never gonna
see each other again.

27
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,912
- That doesn't bother you?
- It kills me.

28
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,252
There he goes. Nice pick.

29
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,285
I gotta take a leak.

30
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,031
You all right?

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:46,435
Yeah, yeah.
Just, uh, a little dizzy.

32
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,168
Get some air.
Hot.

33
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,240
- Joey.
- What'd you say to him?

34
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,147
Yeah, nice try.
Come on!
Let go of me!

35
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,583
- Let go of me!
Can't you see he's sick?
- Joey!

36
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,212
Let me go!
Something's wrong with him!

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,153
You're not getting out
of this that easy.
Joey.

38
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,658
Either you're dead or you're testifying.

39
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,661
Don't have it.

40
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,323
Budget?
Nope.

41
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,832
Revenue statement. List of expenses.

42
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,835
House has been very busy.

43
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,428
Saving New Jersey from leprosy.
Yes, I know.

44
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,565
Getting me his numbers,
that's your job.

45
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,805
- We're in a meeting.
- I need the lawyer.

46
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,143
Who'd you kill?
Nobody. But it's not even lunch.

47
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,184
I got served with a federal court order.
Some witness went into a coma.

48
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,185
They want me to take a look at him.

49
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,016
What?

50
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,819
They want you
to examine a sick person?

51
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,019
This is a public relations nightmare.

52
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,289
Folk think our staff do
that kind of thing around here,

53
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,831
this place will be crawling
with sick people.

54
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,198
I'm a doctor. I'm not a lapdog
for the feds. I don't play fetch.

55
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,433
Nobody tells you what to do.
Am I right, Dr. Cuddy?

56
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,773
You have three choices.
Hire a lawyer to fight the order,
treat the guy or go to jail for contempt.

57
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,176
Up to you.

58
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,650
Jail. You'd like that.
No more naughty schoolgirl.

59
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,209
Conjugal visit-- that's her new fantasy.

60
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,288
We're not leaving until he's gone,
or you show me...

61
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,628
one good reason for keeping him.

62
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,658
He's really out of it, huh?

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,927
Causes of coma--
metabolic, structural--
He had his stomach pumped.

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,489
Why would they do that?
Rule out poisoning.

65
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,501
Huh.
Not the typical first guess.

66
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,302
Nope, first guess was faking it.
The patient's a federal witness--
reluctant, I'm assuming.

67
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,433
He's also an eight on
the Glasgow Coma Scale.

68
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,875
He's barely alive.
Pretty tough to fake.

69
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,846
Any recent history of head trauma?
Bad car accident? Fall?

70
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,246
They tell me no,
but do an M.R.I. to be sure.

71
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,285
Metabolic causes--
liver, kidney, diabetes--

72
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,445
Check for everything.
Feds are paying.

73
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,682
We're gonna turn a profit
on this one, boys.

74
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,851
Dr. House, Bill Arnello.
I'm a lawyer.

75
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,362
I represent Mr. Smith.
What's wrong with him?

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,625
Do I come to you
with my problems?

77
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,259
He's also my brother.

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,530
What? You changed your name?

79
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,038
Smith wasn't good enough for you?

80
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,904
His name's Joey.
He's my only brother.
He's important to you.

81
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,470
Got it. So, no placebos for him.
We'll use the real medicine.

82
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,572
This was fun.
Let's do it again soon.

83
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,488
Brother in the Mafia?

84
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,226
So, just joey?

85
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,320
I was hoping for a nickname.

86
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,730
Joey Mango.
Joey the Wrench.

87
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,437
People know where I am.
I want you to do your job.

88
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,171
Diagnose him,
fix him and keep him here.

89
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:52,480
We're a bit of a specialized hospital.
We generally only deal with patients
while they're actually sick.

90
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,816
If you release my brother
to the government,

91
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,345
and he does what they want,
even if you fix him, he's dead.

92
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,358
I need time to convince him of that.

93
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,027
Good news is,
if you screw up,

94
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,437
you don't have to worry
about a malpractice suit.

95
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,111
Instead, one by one,

96
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,011
I'll take away the things you love
till there's nothing left.

97
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,454
So, on the Mafia thing,

98
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,514
that's a yes.

99
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,002
Did House seem weird to you?

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,004
Were you expecting him
to be weird?

101
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,474
We spoke...

102
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,976
about how we felt.

103
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,740
You told him you liked him?
No, ofcourse not.

104
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,375
Wh-What are you talking about then?
I asked him if he liked me.

105
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,511
Why would you do that?
Because--

106
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,083
I like him.

107
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,389
You like him like him?

108
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,656
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't like me.

109
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,166
Hey, he doesn't like anybody.

110
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,736
And nobody likes him.

111
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,036
M.R.I. showed a subdural hematoma.

112
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,204
Bleeding around his brain
caused pressure inside his head,
which caused the coma.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,372
These look like pseudo-membranes.

114
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,382
Those take time to form.

115
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,680
If it's an old injury,
it wouldn't cause the coma.

116
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,848
Patient history indicates he was hit
with a tire iron in 1996.

117
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,289
Brother says he was
changing a tire and it slipped.

118
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,691
An old hematoma
placed where this one is
could have caused his coma.

119
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,560
- What about his liver?
- L.F.T.'s are slightly elevated.

120
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,532
Key word is "slightly",
as in not high enough
to cause the coma.

121
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,764
It's the subdural.
I say we evacuate the cavity,
see if he wakes up.

122
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,275
The neurologist thinks it's his brain
and wants to open up his head?
Frankly, I'm shocked.

123
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,244
And you get to use the "big boy" drill
in Daddy's big red toolbox.

124
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,043
No drilling.

125
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,079
- Hi.
- Mr. Smith.

126
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,919
Call me Joe.
Can you not do that?

127
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,158
So, we're clear about the no drilling?

128
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,301
He's okay now. He can leave.

129
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,338
I'm not releasing him.
'Cause the brother
doesn't want you to?

130
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,863
Or because he had
an unexplained coma.
Which sounds better?

131
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,469
The hematoma caused the coma.
That's a catchy diagnosis.
You could dance to that.

132
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,810
I think Chase is right.

133
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,884
It still should be evacuated,
but it's not an immediate threat.

134
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,661
Cameron's my girl.

135
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,822
I'd release him.

136
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,931
- Are you disagreeing with me because--
- I'm disagreeing because
that's my medical opinion.

137
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,494
Ofcourse it is.

138
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,133
But unless I've been named as
the fourth part of the "axis of evil",

139
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,939
invaded and occupied,
this is still not a democracy.

140
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:10,210
He's staying.
Send for hepatitis serologies
and an autoimmune panel.

141
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,495
Hey, I'm with you.

142
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,556
Old enough to drink,
old enough to do something really stupid
and make yourself a baby.

143
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,330
He's my brother. I'm watching him
while our parents are in Barbados.

144
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,202
He's having trouble breathing,
and there's a lot of wheezing.

145
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:38,300
Whistling, technically.
Upper airways. Nose.

146
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,904
If he's got the croup, that--
that could become meningitis, right?
Absolutely.

147
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,712
I-- I was just studying,
and all of a sudden I hear him crying
and sounding all weird.

148
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,221
Oh-- M-My parents
are gonna kill me.

149
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,916
I doubt it.
You don't know them.

150
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,722
No, I doubt you were studying
while your parents were away.

151
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,232
Hello, Officer.

152
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,270
You might wanna rinse this off
before you let him play with it again.

153
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,281
What happened? Where is he?

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,423
Vogler called Admitting.
Admitting called Justice.
Justice came and took him away.

155
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,796
And who called Vogler?

156
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,367
He loses money.

157
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,072
So does Ophthalmology.
Who cares? This is a hospital.

158
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,708
- You can't just cut a department.
- You can't control him.

159
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,878
I am the only one that
can control him.

160
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,388
# D-D-Dr. House in the house #

161
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,390
Impeccable timing as always.

162
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,619
You had no authority
to release my patient.

163
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,960
My colleague has just informed me
she has a singular talent.

164
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,865
You are just in time
for a demonstration.

165
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,963
Dr. House, from what I understand,

166
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,304
your patient--
From what you understand--
He's not your patient.

167
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,900
How the hell
do you understand anything?
It's sad.

168
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:24,644
- You're not even a doctor.
- John Smith is here
only because of a court order.

169
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,447
I had the records faxed to the judge.
She rescinded the order.

170
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,923
- Why bother? Just to piss me off?
- Keeping the government off our ass.

171
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,016
Hmm. Yeah.

172
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,995
- That makes no sense
for a public institution.
- Okay.

173
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,091
- Okay, what?
- Okay, sir.

174
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,102
Carry on.

175
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,140
He really cares about his patients.

176
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,042
Yeah, and he just
walked out of here with nothin'.
Something's up.

177
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,274
Just started vomiting and passed out.

178
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,010
More lidocaine. 590, with epi.

179
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,022
Thirty-five-year-old male.
Vital signs are stable now.
Gave him two liters en route.

180
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,316
He was just released from here
two hours ago.

181
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,556
You said he was good to go.

182
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,031
Watch that line.
He's still not responding.

183
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,638
So, the junior G-man badge
isn't looking so good.

184
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,610
- His liver's worse.
- Comatose?

185
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,153
No. Completely different
symptoms than the first time.

186
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,021
His serology tests came back
positive for hepatitis "C".

187
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,788
Hep "C" is a chronic condition.
You don't think
this is an acute situation?

188
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,490
Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain.
Hep "C" explains everything.

189
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,761
- Except for the suddenness of the onset.
- What's wrong with the timing?

190
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,793
You get home one night,
your wife hits you with a baseball bat.

191
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,808
Likely causes:
The fact that you haven't thanked her
for dinner in eight years...

192
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,869
or the receipt for fur handcuffs
that she found in your pants?

193
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,346
Sudden onset
equals approximate cause.

194
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,784
He also has high estrogen levels
in his blood. That's indicative
of a chronic condition, not acute.

195
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,016
One test.
What do his other liver tests tell us?

196
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,184
Normal albumen levels
point toward acute.

197
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,696
Oh, okay, and, uh, why is her test
better than mine?

198
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,564
Because she's cuter,
though it's close.

199
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,002
Do a liver biopsy.
When the results come back,
we'll know what we're looking at.

200
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:30,474
Why wait to treat the hep "C"?
If I'm right,
Joey gets better that much faster.

201
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,309
Right. Then he gets to testify.
And you get a gold star from Cuddy.

202
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,373
And what's the downside?
Or is that the downside?

203
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,647
Do I have a reason for not
wanting you to get any stars?

204
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,852
Fine. Start the treatment.

205
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,917
It's all your idea.
Don't even mention my name.

206
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,827
There's nothing wrong
with your theory. Go.

207
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,201
But in the "humor me" department,
get a biopsy while you're at it.

208
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,171
Foreman, we need to talk.

209
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,575
- You're off the case.
- What?

210
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,950
- Why?
- Somebody told Vogler that I lied
to the transplant committee.

211
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,717
- You think I did?
- You're too careful.

212
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,727
You wouldn't jump ship unless
you knew what was in the water.
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

213
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,888
But I want Vogler
to think I think it's you.

214
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,525
And I want Cameron and Chase,
Cuddy and Wilson, the nursing staff...

215
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,865
and the cashier in the parking lot
to think that too.

216
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,034
Right.

217
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,042
The blood tests show
you have hepatitis "C".

218
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,580
It's a virus that infects the liver.

219
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,980
No way.
It's not all bad news.

220
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,577
It can often be cured.
And even if not, it's manageable.

221
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:52,420
How'd my brother get this?
It usually involves
the exchange of bodily fluids. Either--

222
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,982
Bodily fluids?
What are you talkin' about?

223
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,120
There are many ways
the virus can be transmitted--
sharing needles, blood transfusions--

224
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,065
Hey! Nobody talks to my brother
like this, okay?

225
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,261
Fine. No idea how he got it.

226
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,634
But he has hepatitis "C".
We're gonna start him on--

227
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,305
He doesn't have it.
Don't mention it again.
Don't treat him for it.

228
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,683
House has some directed donations,

229
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,687
foundation support--

230
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,689
It's around here.

231
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,391
He makes you miserable.

232
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,328
Eight years he's worked here--
never made a dime for you.

233
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,332
Never listened to you.
He can change. He's--

234
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
He hasn't changed in eight years.

235
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,334
Either he can't change,
or you can't change him.

236
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,766
You have no idea how many times
he's lied to you,
undercut your authority,

237
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,971
made you look like crap
to other doctors.

238
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,780
Yes, I hate him,
and here I am desperately trying
to protect his job.

239
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,376
- What does that tell you?
- That you don't hate him.

240
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,917
I do not protect people I like.

241
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,221
I protect people
who are assets to this hospital.

242
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,194
No. That's me.

243
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,658
You--

244
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,293
- You're softer.
- Right.

245
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,099
There are three female
chiefs of medicine...

246
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,106
at major hospitals in this country,

247
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,472
and we all got there
using our feminine wiles.

248
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:21,172
- It's human nature to want to
protect people we like.
- I don't like him.

249
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,579
To think if we just form
the right team, we'll all get along
and be able to pull the boat--

250
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,642
- I don't get along with him!
- This is not a team.

251
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,986
It's not a boat.
It's not a machine that has a lot
of parts that have to work together.

252
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,517
The metaphors are all crap.
This is a business. That's all it is.

253
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,759
You like him.
That's bad for business.

254
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,367
Oh, this is all my fault.

255
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,277
Took another homework break
with Betty Lou?

256
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,338
No, last week
I showed him a magic trick.

257
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,284
You pulled a quarter
out of his nose.
It's a classic.

258
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,254
Yeah, and now he won't stop
shovin' stuff up there.

259
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,520
- Dr. House.
- Got a crisis here.

260
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,628
It's okay.

261
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,733
Stop!

262
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,152
That's a neat trick.

263
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,154
They have to believe
you'll actually hurt them.

264
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,156
Ah.

265
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,064
Your people insulted my brother.

266
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,568
What, they put Romano in
the Parmesan cheese shaker again?

267
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,264
Said he was a crackhead
or a homo or somethin'.

268
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,272
Those idiots.

269
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,798
How many times am I gonna have
to send them for sensitivity training?

270
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,812
Nobody's saying he's a homo.
That would be really, really bad.

271
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,371
So let's put a nice, friendly spin on it.

272
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,613
Let's go with, "He got raped in prison".

273
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,620
I saw the jailhouse tats.

274
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,248
Put it together with the blood tests.

275
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,091
There were rumors,
but joey never said anything about it.

276
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,188
If people find out
he's bein' treated for hep "C"--

277
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,136
Feds get that chart,
someone says somethin'
to somebody, word will get out.

278
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,333
And then Joey's manhood, his rep--
he's destroyed.

279
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:37,114
You're worried about how his coworkers
will react at the Wal-Mart in Des Moines.

280
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,276
He's not going into Witness Protection.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

281
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,988
Listen, I don't know
if you know about this,

282
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,185
but mob businesses
sometimes keep two sets of books.

283
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,821
- One legit, one not.
- Exactly.

284
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,467
You jerkin' my chain?

285
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,198
Doctors are busy.
Sometimes they forget to write things down.
Happens all the time.

286
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,008
Thanks.

287
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,272
Oh, and, uh,

288
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,340
whatever you're not giving him
for whatever he doesn't have,

289
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,351
is that gonna fix him?

290
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,555
I doubt it.

291
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,933
On your way to polish Vogler's car?

292
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,062
Gone are the days
of the grumpy old doc...

293
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,767
seeing patients in the basement
of his house, getting paid a few chickens.

294
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,403
- How will I eat?
- You know what Cuddy's been
locked away with Vogler about...

295
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,674
all day today and yesterday?

296
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,545
Floor polish costs through the roof?

297
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:48,416
You. Her secretary's been at
the photocopier all day
with your records.

298
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,218
That's all they're looking at in there.
My car's been stolen.

299
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,860
Or rein-car-nated.

300
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,770
Pink slip.

301
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,535
A gift from the Arnello brothers.

302
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,875
You know, they're gangsters, sure,

303
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,940
but they're thoughtful too.

304
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,486
You can't keep it.
It's... graft.

305
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,683
No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

306
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,159
Graft is if I tell him I'll only make him
better if he slips me a couple bucks.

307
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,198
Or a payoff for something
I'm not supposed to do.

308
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,257
If I'd asked for the payoff,
which I didn't,

309
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,269
I would've done the bad thing anyway.

310
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,464
So there's nothing wrong with this.

311
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,473
Right.
Damn.

312
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,442
Sixty-five.

313
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,444
Perfectly restored.

314
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,949
What do you think a guy like Joey
would do if someone turned down a gift?

315
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,611
That's kind of an insult, isn't it?

316
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,850
He might hurt you.
It's definitely possible.

317
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,325
I'm screwed.
Gotta take the car.

318
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,000
Did you see House's new car?

319
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,003
From Joey.
He obviously can't keep it.

320
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,801
You don't mind the hospital
taking money from Vogler?

321
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,035
That's different. Vogler's legit.

322
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,739
That's worse.
Vogler's money came with strings.

323
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,214
Vogler doesn't set me up
to have a mobster take a swing at me.

324
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,414
- I'm sure House didn't know--
- Joey's pressure dropped.

325
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,820
Pushed I.V. fluids,
now he's holding a hundred systolic.

326
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,121
Septic?
No, it looks like
he's bleeding into his liver.

327
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,787
Varices. See it
with chronic hep "C" all the time.

328
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,696
Biopsy's back.

329
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,166
Two findings. Number one,

330
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,068
lymphocytic infiltrate
and no bridging fibrosis.

331
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,732
Whatever's killing him's
not hep "C". It's acute.

332
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,139
Who said that? I forget.

333
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,542
What are you doing here?
I told you you were off the case.

334
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:01,416
Right. Your diabolic plan to convince
the evil genius he's in the clear,

335
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,511
so he'll let his guard down
and make a fatal mistake.

336
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,386
Sure.
Well, it's clearly
not gonna work now.

337
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,551
What evil genius?

338
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,086
If we knew that,
we wouldn't need a diabolic plan,
would we?

339
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,602
- House thinks someone
ratted him out to Vogler.
- What, one of us?

340
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,001
No, you guys love me too much.

341
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,566
Look, if it's not the hep "C",
then what's the problem?
What's causing the liver failure?

342
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,578
Finding number two, toxins.

343
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:32,049
No. He's only 30 years old,
and his job doesn't expose him
to heavy metals or environmental--

344
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,278
He's a 30-year-old mobster.

345
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,345
He doesn't have a job that results
in accidental exposure to toxins.

346
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,755
He has a job that results
in intentional exposure to toxins.

347
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,431
Someone's poisoned him.

348
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,846
Whatever this toxin is,
it's doing the job and fast.

349
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,385
How long till we have
the next round of test results?

350
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,616
- About four hours.
- Too bad his liver's only
gonna last another two.

351
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,454
- We're gonna have to get him a new one.
- What, in two hours?

352
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,697
There is another way.

353
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,461
Relax. It's kosher.

354
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,877
This is so bizarre.

355
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,715
Not really. We just take
Joey's blood out of his body...

356
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,949
and run it through a pig.

357
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:49,392
The pig's liver does what joey's can't.
It cleans the blood.

358
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,395
Which we send right back to him.

359
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,133
And the pig makes him better?

360
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,727
Nope. Just buys us some time
to figure out what's poisoning your brother.

361
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,963
Like nothin'.
Like you do this all the time.

362
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,101
Oh, we've basically got
a barn in the basement.

363
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,285
Cross off hemlock.

364
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,413
You thought he was being
poisoned by hemlock?

365
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,583
Dr. Euripides tell you
to check for that?

366
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,093
It grows wild by the highways out here.

367
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,427
So, how much do you like House?

368
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,533
- Chase has a big mouth.
- Yeah. He's probably the one
who ratted to Vogler.

369
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,801
- I don't think that he would--
- Does it hurt when you're with House?

370
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,308
Little pain in the tummy,
but it sort of feels good too?

371
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,675
- I don't have the right to show
interest in someone?
- You absolutely do.

372
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,214
And I absolutely have the right
to humiliate you for it.

373
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,918
Anything?

374
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,446
White blood count's low,
probably a result of the illness.
Nothing to connect to the liver.

375
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,458
Is he a smoker?
Let me check.

376
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,122
Early signs of emphysema.
He's been smoking
at least a dozen years.

377
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,135
Eighteen. You got that
from the white count?

378
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,569
Nope. Got that from the chest X-ray.

379
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,607
White count just tells me he's quitting.

380
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,510
Two weeks ago.

381
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,688
How's your tummy?

382
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,016
Flat and taut.

383
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,585
I've been on the job for 12 years.

384
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:36,123
You put $3,000 in your wife's
checking account this morning.
I wanna know where it came from.

385
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,661
I got a perfect record.
Where did you get the money?

386
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,105
Cancel the thumbscrews.
I've got our culprit.

387
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,608
Who?
Not who, "Hu".

388
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,908
- Huh?
- Thanks for playing along.

389
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,972
Chai Hu. Chinese herb
in his "quit smoking" candy.

390
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,350
Reduces cravings.
Also reduces his white blood count.

391
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,719
Oh, yeah, he also took enough
of them to poison himself.

392
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,055
We'll keep him on the pig
for a few more hours,
and then take him off the candy.

393
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,061
He'll be fine.

394
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,962
Pig won't be. Oh, no.

395
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,342
Hey.

396
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,816
Hey, feelin' better?

397
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,875
I'm famished.

398
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,887
I think they got fish sticks
on the menu.

399
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,254
Ah, yeah.
Makes me miss prison.

400
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,362
So, the mobster's good to go?

401
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,491
I'll keep him overnight,
then let the feds know...

402
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,001
he's good to rat out
whoever he wants.

403
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,005
- Brother won't be happy.
- Maybe I have to give back the car.

404
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,742
You should let Vogler tell the feds.
Why?

405
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,370
Because it matters to him.

406
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,040
Because you humiliated him
the first time Joey was released.

407
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,949
- You think you should still
be in third there, ace?
- He humiliated himself.

408
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,581
And because your job depends
on the kind of mood Vogler's in
at the end of his marathon with Cuddy.

409
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:09,718
Seriously, man, have you ever
actually driven an automobile before?
There are four gears, you know?

410
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,127
The '66 came with a "shut up" button.

411
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,545
I have a problem with the tests.

412
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,816
I need to know--

413
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,595
It is my medical opinion that the patient
is healthy and can be released.

414
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,899
Thanks for letting us know.

415
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,633
Get me the U.S. Attorney's office.

416
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,075
I see you found out
what we're meeting about.
You're having a meeting?

417
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,410
Well, whatever the reason,
the coat looks good on you.

418
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,914
Chai Hu lozenges cause
this kind of liver failure? No way.

419
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,752
Not by themselves.
But in combination with the interferon
it's like gas to a flame.

420
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,348
- What interferon?
- For the hep "C".

421
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,691
- What hep "C"?
- Oops.

422
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,322
Is hiding a mobster's hep "C"
that important?

423
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,333
Is letting the feds know everything
that important?

424
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,029
You are a piece of work.
Even now, knowing--
Ed--

425
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,368
Edward.

426
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
Joey's back in a coma.

427
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,715
He's stable, but comatose.

428
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,717
Worse than before.
He's on a ventilator.

429
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,719
Question is, why?

430
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,220
It's not his brain.
It's not a toxin.

431
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,886
Our friend Babe
helped with that one.

432
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,054
- So, what else?
- Hep "C".

433
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,567
We never really treated it.
We stopped the interferon
when it started poisoning his liver.

434
00:28:56,634 --> 00:29:00,195
Am I gonna have to write
a song about it?
His chronic hep "C"...

435
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,865
was not bad enough
to produce these symptoms.

436
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,910
- The estrogen level indicates it is.
- It indicates something else entirely.

437
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:10,175
We can't give him interferon now.
There are still traces
of the lozenges in his system.

438
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,341
It'll just poison him again.
Genetics.

439
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,408
We don't treat the virus,
we change it.

440
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,784
A nonnucleoside allosteric inhibitor.

441
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,914
It's never been tried on a human being.
It could kill him.

442
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,221
- What's the difference?
He's dead without it.
- They're running a trial...

443
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,887
on dogs at St. Sebastian's
out in Philadelphia.

444
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,897
I'll make the call.

445
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,598
What else could cause
his estrogen level to be that high?

446
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,270
Nothing.

447
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,894
We're gonna put the medicine in here.

448
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,829
Don't want it to burn his veins
when it goes in.

449
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,867
And you have no idea if it'll work.

450
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,993
It's shown promise in testing.

451
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,749
Ma-Maybe there's nothing up there.
I watched him like a hawk.

452
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,916
Pretty sure you didn't.

453
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,960
I-- I didn't let him play
with any more little toys.

454
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,020
Thus forcing him
to shove a big one up there.

455
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,431
Stop, or I snap your nose off!

456
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,544
He-- He's not too smart.

457
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:54,051
Genetics is a powerful force.

458
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,425
On the other hand,
maybe he's smarter than you think.

459
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,864
What's goin' on?
Just give me a second.

460
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,734
Always wanted to use one of these.

461
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,107
Tilt his head back.
I-- I don't know. I do--

462
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,947
Just tilt his head back.

463
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,867
Nice grasp of concepts.
Relationships. Very smart.

464
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,029
Very cool.

465
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,903
First the policeman, the fireman,
then the fire truck.

466
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,535
Your brother was sending in teams
to save the cat.

467
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,239
Wow.

468
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,142
Sometimes the simplest answer--

469
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,720
What types of comas
do you just snap out of?

470
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,663
He's not snapping out of this one.
He's not improving.

471
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,759
You've crossed out estrogen.
You got an explanation?

472
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,498
Yes, I have, a very simple one.

473
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,200
And?

474
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,334
It's private.

475
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,781
You think I'm the one--
running to Vogler.

476
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,578
You're currently top of the list.

477
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,986
Toxic comas--

478
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,992
Person's away from the cause
long enough, they recover.

479
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,587
The feds checked for poisons.
We checked for poisons.
I didn't do it.

480
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,724
It's not a poison then.
An allergy.

481
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,963
- Did you hear me?
- What about a food sensitivity?

482
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,271
All his food is strictly controlled.
There's no correlation
between his meals and his condition.

483
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,743
He had steak and potatoes
before the first coma,

484
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,406
and the hospital served fish sticks
before the second one.

485
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,883
You can trust me.

486
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,454
Problem is, if I can't trust you,

487
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,994
I can't trust your statement
that I can trust you.

488
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,929
But thanks anyway.
You've been a big help.

489
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,969
So, where did
you get the money?
What?

490
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,574
Someone paid you off.
What are you talkin' about?

491
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,584
He wasn't poisoned.
You told us that--

492
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,918
Who's talking about poison?
I'm talking about payoffs, graft.

493
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,220
Leave him alone.

494
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,623
You paid the marshal off.

495
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,927
I didn't pay him to poison my brother.

496
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,491
No. It just worked out that way.

497
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,663
I gave the guy some money
to bring in some decent food.

498
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,505
Better than fish sticks?
I'm thinking steak.

499
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,908
We asked for pasta,
but those stupid feds
could care less--

500
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,276
He had steak before both comas.

501
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:47,340
Your brother has
ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

502
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,943
Want me to write it down?

503
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:54,048
Good, 'cause it takes a while.
It's genetic, can present at any time.

504
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,617
If the patient eats
a large amount of protein,
especially if he's not used to it--

505
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,791
What, that's it?
He just stays off the red meat,
and he's gonna be fine?

506
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,801
Yes. If I'm right and we stop
the current treatment,
he gets better.

507
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,635
If we stop the current treatment
and I'm wrong, he dies.

508
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,766
- Why would you be wrong?
- His estrogen level.

509
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,437
O.T.D. doesn't explain
his estrogen level.

510
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,642
But I have a theory.

511
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,583
There is one chemical that,
if ingested,

512
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,917
can cause a person's
estrogen level to increase dramatically.

513
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,152
- What is it?
- It's called estrogen.

514
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,088
Joey's taking estrogen?
What, he wants a sex change?

515
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,098
No, nothing like that.

516
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,761
It's called "Male Flame".

517
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:43,170
It's probably more
consumer-friendly
in the original Chinese.

518
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,267
It's an herbal aphrodisiac
marketed to gay men.

519
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,246
- Ah, here we go.
- And it's sold on the same Web site
that sells his Chai Hu lozenges.

520
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,340
Guess what's in it?
It starts with an "E".

521
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,885
You wanna get hit too?

522
00:35:55,953 --> 00:36:00,583
That would be quite a trick.
He slapped me so hard,
his brother turned straight.

523
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,094
Joey's a big-time mobster.
Guys like that don't get raped in prison.

524
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,189
They get gifts.
They get food, drugs, cigarettes.

525
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,826
Cable TV.

526
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,004
Joey is not gay.

527
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,439
Maybe not gay, but certainly delightful.

528
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:24,141
You, on the other hand,
hitting a doctor,
even if it was only Chase,

529
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:28,208
and asking another one to keep
Joey's chart fresh and homo-free--

530
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,447
that's a bit of an overreaction,
wouldn't you say?

531
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,480
It's almost like you're scared
that it might be true.
You're wrong.

532
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,926
Okay. Then don't
stop the treatment.

533
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,364
But if you're wrong, he dies.

534
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,130
Okay.

535
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,939
He never said anything
to me about it, not once.

536
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,820
That's what I love about you mob guys,
so tolerant of others.

537
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,883
So accepting.

538
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,125
Only way he was coming out
was way, way out.

539
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,295
Lose the tattoos, change his name,
move to another town.

540
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,567
How's a guy like him gonna do that?

541
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,574
Witness Protection.

542
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,668
It's not just for witnesses anymore.

543
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,179
You can go in now,
sit with him if you want.

544
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,563
- How much longer?
- It's only been three hours.

545
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:32,337
- If it's the O.T.D.--
- If it's the O.T.D.?
What if House is wrong, huh?

546
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,573
That severe a reaction,
it'll take some time--

547
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,980
- He makes these assumptions
about people, talks you into things--
- Mr. Arnello--

548
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,851
He's awake.
He wants to see you.

549
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,962
You look like crap.

550
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,023
That's a joke.
See? I'm sick.
I said you look like crap.

551
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,296
You have no idea
what I just went through out there.

552
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,036
You kept gettin' worse.

553
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,235
And Dr. House kept sayin' all this crap.

554
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,637
You know, if-- if I think
you're normal, then he's gonna
keep giving you the medicine.

555
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,810
- If you weren't--
- Weren't what?

556
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,122
Normal?

557
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,558
Yeah.

558
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,195
He said you were a fag.

559
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,363
Witness Protection--
that's your big chance to be one.

560
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,936
- You believed him?
- I don't know what to believe.

561
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,567
You were sick.

562
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:43,636
I had to make a decision.
I thought you were gonna die.

563
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,619
You believed him.

564
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,624
He stopped the medicine.

565
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,427
Here I am.

566
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,862
- I wanted to talk to you about this.
- There's nothin' to talk about.

567
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,708
You, uh,

568
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:21,684
ordered some
Chinese Internet health crap,

569
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,756
and they sent the wrong pills,
and you took 'em.

570
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,259
Yeah, yeah. That, uh--

571
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,255
That must be it.

572
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,811
You wanna testify?

573
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,914
Go ahead.

574
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,974
I told the doc. He said it's okay.

575
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,020
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't.

576
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,158
All I need to know
is you're my brother, Joey.

577
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,466
If you think this...

578
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,402
thing, whatever,
is gonna make you happy,

579
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,743
then I think you should do it.

580
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,016
You should.

581
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,017
Vogler wants to fire you.

582
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,964
Lose the whole department.

583
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,660
Good thing
you fought for me though, right?

584
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,603
Dress was a nice move,
but you gotta follow it up.

585
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,697
Nasty weekend in Vegas.

586
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,937
Something that shows off
your real administrative skills.

587
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,842
He threatened to fire me.

588
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,083
I'm sorry.

589
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,488
So, how long do I have?
I've got a lot of personal stuff
to pack up.

590
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,619
And I assume you're gonna
want to throw a party.

591
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,663
I told him I know
where the bodies are buried.

592
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:18,293
The stuff he needs to know
that's not in the books.
I told him he can't ditch me.

593
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,929
He's only keeping you on
because you know the secret handshakes.

594
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,372
He's a quick study.
Six months, he'll have the moves down.
He won't need you anymore.

595
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,376
- I'll deal with that then.
- So I stay.

596
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,208
Yes.

597
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,511
But some things are going to change.

598
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,983
Profits. New world order.

599
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,114
Everything's about profits.
Yeah, that's real new.

600
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,092
You could rent out the Corvette
every once in a while
or lend it to a friend.

601
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,561
That would be easy,
and it would be wrong.

602
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,427
But Cuddy stood up for you.

603
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,467
To a point.

604
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,468
To what point?

605
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:56,267
I gotta do six more
clinic hours a month.
So do two of them.

606
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,174
Why only two?

607
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,178
'Cause one of them's gone.

608
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,707
I gotta fire somebody.

609
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,100
Good morning.
