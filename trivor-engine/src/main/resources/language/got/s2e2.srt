3
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:02,811
(indistinct voices)

4
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,034
Boy.

5
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:19,451
Lovely boy.

6
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,282
What do you want?

7
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,360
A man has a thirst.

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,778
The man does not drink
for a day and a night.

9
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,113
A boy could make a friend.

10
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:29,639
I have friends.

11
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,137
Give us a beer. Before I skin you.

12
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,606
A man does not choose his companions.

13
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,543
These two, they have no courtesy.

14
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,515
A man must ask forgiveness.

15
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,468
You're called Arry.

16
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:49,788
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.

17
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,396
Once of the Free City of Lorath.

18
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:53,321
Hey, you little shit.

19
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,281
Get us beer!

20
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,936
You should have asked nicely.

21
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,755
Come closer.

22
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,757
And I'll shove that stick up your
bunghole and fuck you bloody.

23
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:09,999
The boy has more courage than sense.

24
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,349
Come here!

25
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,855
Yoren said none of us were
should go near of those three.

26
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,440
They don't scare me.

27
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,247
Then you're stupid.

28
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,055
They scare me.

29
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,965
Would a gold collector look
this far from King's Landing?

30
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,104
What are you doing?

31
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,172
They're looking for me.

32
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,487
You're in command here?

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,657
You're a long way from home.

34
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,535
I asked you a question.

35
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,310
Aye, you did.

36
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,540
You asked without manners.

37
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,851
And I chose not to answer.

38
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,298
I have a royal warrant.

39
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,129
For one of these gutter
rats you're transporting.

40
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:59,153
Well the thing is,

41
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:03,050
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

42
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,191
That puts them beyond the
reach of kings and queens.

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,135
It's a funny thing.

44
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,351
People worry so much about their throats,

45
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,473
they forget about what's down low.

46
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,657
Now I sharpened this
blade before breakfast.

47
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,629
I could shave a spider's
arse if I wanted to.

48
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:24,460
Or,

49
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,000
I could nick this artery in your leg

50
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,629
and once it's nicked, there's no one
around here who knows how to un-nick it.

51
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:35,313
We'll just keep that.

52
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,510
Good steel is always needed on the wall.

53
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,121
Seems you have a choice.

54
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:46,212
You can die here at this
crossroads a long way from home.

55
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,981
Or you can go back to your
city and tell your masters

56
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,366
you didn't find what you were looking for.

57
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:59,571
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

58
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,069
He carries a bull's head helmet.

59
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,596
Anyone turning him over will
earn the King's reward.

60
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,762
We'll be back. With more men.

61
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:12,814
And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

62
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,258
(Tyrion whistling)

63
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:43,740
(woman laughing)

64
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:48,695
My lord.

65
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,123
You make me wait a long time.

66
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,057
And your friend keeps me company.

67
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,705
We were just speaking of your bravery

68
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:57,625
in the victory against the
Stark auxiliary forces.

69
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,286
It was quite a battle.

70
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,455
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

71
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,675
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

72
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,543
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

73
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:15,219
To find such a lovely creature
working in your father's kitchen.

74
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,566
It almost beggars belief.

75
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,707
Strange things do happen.

76
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,486
You should taste her fish pie.

77
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,237
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

78
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,702
How can you tell?

79
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:28,186
I can always tell.

80
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,887
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

81
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:33,990
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

82
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:39,192
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

83
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,855
Friends are such an important part of life.

84
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,658
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

85
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,724
But rest easy my lord,

86
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:53,059
I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.

87
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,707
Your discretion is legendary,

88
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,106
where your friends are concerned.

89
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:02,062
How unspeakable of me to go on and
on, when all you want to do is rest.

90
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:02,935
I will leave you.

91
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,700
Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.

92
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,545
The city is made brighter by your presence.

93
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,629
We have a council meeting, my lord.

94
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,647
I don't like threats.

95
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:19,790
Who threatened you?

96
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,725
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

97
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:25,512
Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.

98
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,591
Threaten me again and I will
have you thrown into the sea.

99
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:34,397
You might be disappointed in the results.

100
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,123
The storms come and go.

101
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,310
The big fish eat the little fish.

102
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,882
And I keep on paddling.

103
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,851
Come, my lord.

104
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:47,769
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

105
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:56,325
From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm,

106
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,662
but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North.

107
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,061
He has more spirit than his
father, I'll give him that.

108
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:08,924
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

109
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,082
Give him his father's bones back, at
least as a gesture of good faith.

110
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,480
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

111
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,079
I will, Your Grace.

112
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,599
Did you see my brother when
you were the Starks guest?

113
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:22,748
I did.

114
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,078
They have not broken his
spirit, Your Grace.

115
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:28,069
If you speak with him,

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,169
tell him he's not been forgotten.

117
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,138
I will, Your Grace.

118
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,369
Safe travels, cousin.

119
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:40,872
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

120
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:41,967
If that's everything?

121
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:46,763
A raven flew in this
morning from Castle Black.

122
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,061
Trouble with the wildlings?

123
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:51,570
That's why they're called wildlings.

124
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,649
Somewhat less wild these days.

125
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:57,497
It seems they've stopped killing each
other and started following this

126
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,884
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

127
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,864
Another king? How many is that now?
Five? I've lost count.

128
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:06,751
Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man The Wall.

129
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:10,087
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

130
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:14,534
Cold winds are rising, and
the dead rise with them.

131
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,982
The northerners are a superstitious people.

132
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,914
According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.

133
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,051
Mormont doesn't lie.

134
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,787
How do you kill a dead man?

135
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,321
Apparently you burn him.

136
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,604
One trip to The Wall and you come back

137
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:36,507
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

138
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,427
I don't know what I believe,

139
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,718
but here's a fact for you.

140
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,790
The Night's Watch is the
only thing that separates us

141
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,272
from what lies beyond the Wall.

142
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:50,014
I have every confidence the brave men of
the Night's Watch will protect us all.

143
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,235
Night, sir.

144
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:55,415
The gods wanted us to have dignity,

145
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,348
wouldn't make us fart when we died.

146
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:00,752
We fart when we die?

147
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,603
My blessed mother was holding her
own when she left this world.

148
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,411
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

149
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,405
(farting noises)

150
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:21,134
Seems a bit greedy for one
man to have so many wives.

151
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,688
We were having a serious discussion.

152
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,840
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

153
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,615
Would you look at that.

154
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,581
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

155
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,061
I prefer watching them come towards me.

156
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,401
I'm sure that's nice too.

157
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,224
Well, there was a milkmaid

158
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:43,025
named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.

159
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:47,006
And we were wrestling together from
the time we were six years old.

160
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,820
And then we got older,

161
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:53,935
the wrestling, uh …changed.

162
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,296
You were with her?

163
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,339
How many times?

164
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,527
Well, as many times as I could.

165
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,991
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

166
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,815
We need more potatoes.

167
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,954
I'll get another sack for the sludge.

168
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:14,944
Get the turnips too.

169
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,363
No, Ghost, no!

170
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,216
No.

171
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:35,098
Ghost, away. Shoo.
Shoo!

172
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:40,156
You all right?

173
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,505
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

174
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,710
Oh, oh. Right.

175
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,419
I'm sorry. I just wanted to
make sure you weren't hurt.

176
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:58,451
You're very brave.

177
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:09,724
What's he doing?

178
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:11,913
This is Gilly,

179
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,913
she's one of Craster's daughters.

180
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,047
Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?

181
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,306
Sam said you could help.

182
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,198
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...

183
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:21,347
She's pregnant.

184
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,868
We have to take her with us, when we leave.

185
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:31,944
What?

186
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,469
I know it sounds a bit mad.

187
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,311
No it doesn't sound a bit
mad, it's impossible.

188
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,259
- The Lord Commander...
- We are sworn to protect.

189
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,702
- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.

190
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,458
I can still run if I have to.

191
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:43,719
It's just not possible.

192
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,290
I'm going to have a baby,
if it's a boy I...

193
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,711
If it's a boy, what?

194
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,919
You want us to risk our lives for you,
and you won't even tell us why.

195
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,044
Why did you do that?

196
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,667
Do what, ask her a question?

197
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,176
- You were cruel.
- Cruel!?

198
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:10,802
Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

199
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,745
- I didn't touch her!
- No you just want to steal her,

200
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,331
what do you think Craster
cuts off for that?

201
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,878
I can't steal her,

202
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,668
she's a person not a goat.

203
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:26,043
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

204
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:28,085
We can't take a girl with us.

205
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:30,310
Mormont wouldn't have it.
And even if he would,

206
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,897
what would we do with her?

207
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,885
Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

208
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,343
I could try...

209
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,915
What? I've read about it.

210
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,842
A bit.

211
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:44,824
I'm sorry Sam,

212
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,350
we can't help her.

213
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,136
Khaleesi.

214
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,689
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

215
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,774
Who did this?

216
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,625
Khal Pono perhaps,

217
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,613
Khal Jhaqo...

218
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,582
They don't like the idea of a
woman leading a Khalasaar.

219
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:43,552
They will like it far less
when I'm done with them.

220
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:14,443
Is it as you remember my lord?

221
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:16,324
Looks smaller.

222
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:18,347
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

223
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:21,681
I remember my father's cabin, felt
like a palace when I was little.

224
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:23,761
Now look at it...

225
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,034
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

226
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:28,694
Who will?

227
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:30,605
Anyone who matters,

228
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,215
this is a big day for them.

229
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:35,425
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

230
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,302
It's a hard place the Iron Islands...

231
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:39,980
always has been.

232
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,059
It's cold and it's wet.

233
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,650
I love the cold and wet.

234
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,422
They say hard places breed hard men,

235
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:50,038
and hard men rule the world.

236
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,774
Then you'll be king before long.

237
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:58,957
Try smiling with your lips closed.

238
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,811
Hmm, better.

239
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,159
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

240
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,843
I don't blame him.

241
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,986
He says that you're all reavers and rapers.

242
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:14,010
And that no matter how many women you have,

243
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,702
you'll never be satis...

244
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:18,527
Quit talking about your father.

245
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,821
He's right about us.

246
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,129
Our wives from the Iron Islands,

247
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:27,860
they're for breeding.
That's not enough for us.

248
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,950
That's why we take saltwives
from the women we capture.

249
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,105
Capture me!
Take me with you when you go ashore.

250
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:39,149
- Make me your saltwife.
- Your place is on this ship.

251
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,053
Not after you leave.

252
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:45,194
Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.

253
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,578
I haven't paid you.

254
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,053
I barely touched her.

255
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:29,688
And you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.

256
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:32,533
- And this is what I get, crying.
- One moment, my friend.

257
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:33,588
A moment.

258
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,762
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

259
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,424
Ramka will take good care of you.

260
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,631
- Sorry my lord.
- Shhh.

261
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,189
Did he hurt you?

262
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,680
Not, my lord.

263
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:30,191
- It's Megan.
- Who?

264
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:33,920
She works for you.

265
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:40,335
She's the one, the girl whose,
they killed her baby.

266
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:45,347
Ah, yes, that was
poorly handled.

267
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:50,871
Sometimes those with the
most power have the least grace.

268
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,738
Can't stop thinking about it,

269
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:57,138
I can't sleep.

270
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,837
Her poor little baby.

271
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:04,205
You know you remind
me of another girl?

272
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,310
A lovely thing I once acquired
from an Elysium pleasure house.

273
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,540
Beautiful, like yourself,

274
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,238
and intelligent as yourself.

275
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,320
But she wasn't happy.

276
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:24,753
She cried, often.
I asked her why but,

277
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:29,471
we didn't have the kind of
rapport that you and I have.

278
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,727
Yes, it was quite sad.

279
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,805
Girls from Elysium pleasure
houses are expensive.

280
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,876
Extremely expensive.

281
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:45,114
And this one wasn't making me any money.

282
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,557
I hate bad investments.

283
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,726
Really, I do.

284
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,843
They haunt me.

285
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:03,005
I had no idea how to make her happy,

286
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:06,434
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

287
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:12,154
A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money

288
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:17,325
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

289
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:22,733
To use her in ways that
never occur to most men.

290
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,753
And you know what occurs to most men.

291
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:33,801
I wouldn't say he succeeded
in making her happy

292
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:39,144
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

293
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,290
Take tonight off.
Tomorrow, Megan's child

294
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,174
will see you tomorrow.

295
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,388
Better be happy.

296
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,866
That makes me happy.

297
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,443
More wine?

298
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,727
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

299
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:17,851
Leave us, Podrik.

300
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:19,591
I believe we know
how to pour our own wine.

301
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:24,355
Is that your new squire?
Could have found you a proper lad.

302
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:27,229
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

303
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:29,064
Hmm, that's a good red.

304
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,765
- Dornish?
- You know your wines, my lord.

305
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:32,563
That I do.

306
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:35,739
A fine dinner, my lord.

307
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,142
Call me Tyrion, please.

308
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,671
I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

309
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:42,788
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

310
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,619
Wars have been started for less.

311
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:48,020
I heard there was some trouble

312
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,769
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

313
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:52,669
Hmm. Nasty business,
had to be done.

314
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:53,682
Yes, of course.

315
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,330
City Watch must keep the peace.

316
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,826
Only, I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.

317
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,012
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

318
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,942
Especially the queen's orders.

319
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:06,752
I never said they were the queen's orders.

320
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:10,674
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

321
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:14,490
- She's always been a jealous woman.
- You know your sister better than I do.

322
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,792
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.

323
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:17,913
I don't listen to filth.

324
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:21,226
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

325
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:23,514
I suppose people
who do believe that filth,

326
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,347
consider Robert's bastards
to be better claimants

327
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,973
to the throne than
Cersei's children.

328
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:29,120
Joffrey is my king,
the rest doesn't interest me.

329
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,655
I appreciate your loyalty.

330
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,203
Tell me.

331
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:37,126
When your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,

332
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:39,188
did you give the order?

333
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,207
I did.

334
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,063
And I would again.

335
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:47,391
The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.

336
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:48,480
The fool.

337
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,386
He had no idea you
were already bought.

338
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,166
Are you drunk?

339
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:56,051
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp.

340
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:59,260
I'm not questioning
your honor, Lord Janos.

341
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,707
I'm denying its existence.

342
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:04,484
You think I'll stand here and
take this from you, dwarf.

343
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,395
Dwarf?

344
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,170
You should have stopped at imp.

345
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,829
And yes, you will stand
here and take it from me,

346
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,013
unless you'd like to take
it from my friend here.

347
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:16,176
I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war

348
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:18,600
and seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

349
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,501
well I just wouldn't feel
safe with you lurking about.

350
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,740
What are you…

351
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:24,817
My friends at court will not allow this.

352
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:25,739
The queen herself...

353
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,141
The queen regent.

354
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,313
And you're a fool to
believe she's your friend.

355
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,497
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

356
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,652
No, we shan't.

357
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,128
There's a ship leaving for
East Watch by the Sea tonight.

358
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:46,529
From there, I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

359
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,269
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

360
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:51,089
I found it surprisingly beautiful,

361
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:55,070
in a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

362
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,529
The lads will escort you.

363
00:25:56,893 --> 00:25:58,645
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

364
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,654
These men are under my command.

365
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:03,213
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

366
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:07,068
His name is Bronn and he is the
new commander of the City Watch.

367
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,786
Boys.

368
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,971
I have friends at court.

369
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,518
Powerful friends.

370
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,532
The king himself made me a lord.

371
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,836
To the new Commander.

372
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:36,509
If I told you to murder, an infant girl
say, still at her mother's breast,

373
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,682
would you do it without question?

374
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,654
Without question? No.

375
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,861
I'd ask how much.

376
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:05,227
If they come back, I say we yield.

377
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:06,808
Gendry's the one they want.

378
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,536
I don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

379
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,494
I'm not afraid of no battles.

380
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:13,110
If you got within a mile of a
battle, you'd fill your pants.

381
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,486
I've seen lots of battles.

382
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:15,806
- I saw...
- Liar.

383
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:20,656
I saw a man kill another man just
outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

384
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,669
Stabbed him right in the neck.

385
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,001
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

386
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:26,946
They had armor on.

387
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:28,293
So?

388
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,909
So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

389
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,887
No, it isn't.

390
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,118
What's a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

391
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,834
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

392
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:40,258
Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

393
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:44,617
It's when they've got armor on.

394
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:45,638
I already told you that.

395
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,295
A knight?

396
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:50,338
How'd you know he was a knight?

397
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:55,140
Well, cause they got armor on.

398
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:57,368
You don't have to be a
knight to have armor.

399
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,871
Any idiot can buy armor.

400
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,127
How'd you know?

401
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,440
Cause I sold armor.

402
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,739
What do the gold-clips want with you?

403
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,113
No idea.

404
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,416
You're a liar.

405
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,588
You shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.

406
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:23,855
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

407
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,694
No one gets to insult anyone.

408
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,347
No good's ever come of those questions.

409
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,639
No good's ever come?

410
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:32,194
You've asked questions before?

411
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:35,452
How can someone so small be
such a huge pain in my ass?

412
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,837
Were you asked questions?

413
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,377
The Hand of the King.
The Hands of the King.

414
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:46,483
Lord Arryn came first, a
few weeks before he died.

415
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:49,854
And then Lord Stark came, a
few weeks before he died.

416
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:51,436
Lord Stark.

417
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,885
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

418
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,101
You'll probably be dead soon.

419
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,739
What did they ask about?

420
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,481
- My mom.
- Who's your mom?

421
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,297
Just my mom.

422
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:08,160
Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.

423
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:09,422
And who was your father?

424
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:12,412
He could be one of those gold-hatted
bastards, for all I know.

425
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,014
What about you, anyway?

426
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:16,344
I thought they were after you?

427
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:18,546
Why?

428
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,196
Did you kill someone?
Or is it just because you're a girl?

429
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:23,778
I'm not a girl!

430
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,823
Yes you are.

431
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:27,043
You think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

432
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:30,188
Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
Everyone knows that.

433
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,563
That's true. You're still a girl.

434
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,424
I am not!

435
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:34,280
Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss then.

436
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,310
I don't need to take a piss.

437
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,981
I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?

438
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:46,874
No one can know.

439
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:49,707
They won't. Not from me.

440
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:54,624
My name's not Arry.

441
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:59,143
It's Arya. Of House Stark.

442
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,226
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

443
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,629
He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.

444
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:07,884
He was never a traitor.

445
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:09,787
Joffrey is a liar.

446
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,412
- So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
- No.

447
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:14,569
I mean yes.

448
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:16,618
My mother was a lady, and my sister.

449
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:18,863
You were a lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle.

450
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:21,812
Look, all that about cocks.
I should never have said that.

451
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:24,650
I've been pissing in front
of you and everything.

452
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:27,419
I should be calling you milady.

453
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:28,800
Do not call me milady.

454
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:29,790
As milady commands.

455
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:31,779
Well, that was unladylike.

456
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:01,243
What you carrying?

457
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,499
Pears and oranges.

458
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:06,121
Wine from the Arbor.

459
00:31:07,768 --> 00:31:09,776
And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.

460
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:16,155
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

461
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,635
Me.

462
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:23,867
Don't like wine.

463
00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:25,739
Woman's drink.

464
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:30,446
I need to get to Pyke.

465
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:41,793
I'll find you a horse.

466
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:53,423
I'm heading that way.

467
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:55,351
I can take you there.

468
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:57,719
I bet you can.

469
00:31:58,436 --> 00:31:59,556
You been at sea long?

470
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,310
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

471
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:03,496
None like you.

472
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:04,965
You don't know what I'm like.

473
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,580
You don't know what you're like.

474
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,224
You need someone to teach you.

475
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:11,795
Know who I am?

476
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:15,210
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry.

477
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,817
Lord Greyjoy.

478
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:22,237
Have my things sent up to the castle.

479
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:42,330
You should give me the reins,
I'm a better rider than you.

480
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:44,533
I've been on horseback
for the last nine years.

481
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,114
Nine years. You still know
your way around a ship?

482
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,625
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

483
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,590
Don't you worry about my hands.

484
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,280
The sea's in my blood.

485
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:59,622
You'll never be in the sea if I
don't watch where I'm going.

486
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,954
I have a proposal for my father.

487
00:33:03,221 --> 00:33:05,332
One that will make him king again.

488
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,118
And me after him.

489
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,167
You may stay at the castle
tonight, if you're lucky.

490
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,426
Is that an offer from my future king?

491
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:16,313
An order. From your future king.

492
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:20,968
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

493
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:24,066
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

494
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,016
Father.

495
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,206
Nine years, is it?

496
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,373
They took a frightened boy.

497
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,393
What have they given back?

498
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,423
A man.

499
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:52,511
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

500
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,672
Stark had you longer than I did.

501
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:58,920
Lord Stark is gone.

502
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:03,613
And how do you feel about that?

503
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:08,259
What's done is done.

504
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,497
I've brought you a
proposal from Robb Stark.

505
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:12,964
Who gave you those clothes?

506
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:17,608
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

507
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:20,645
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

508
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:21,544
It will.

509
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:25,422
That bauble around your neck.

510
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,750
Did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

511
00:34:29,855 --> 00:34:31,253
I asked a question.

512
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,062
Did you pull it from the
neck of a corpse you made

513
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:38,014
or did you buy it to
match your fine clothes?

514
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:42,311
Iron or gold?

515
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,248
Gold.

516
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,536
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

517
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,589
My fears have come true.

518
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:01,157
The Starks have made you theirs.

519
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,885
My blood is salt and iron.

520
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,479
Yet, the Stark boy sends you
to me like a trained raven,

521
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,724
clutching his message.

522
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,764
The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

523
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,063
He heeds your counsel?

524
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:13,715
I've lived with him, hunted
with him, fought at his side,

525
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,027
he thinks of me as a brother.

526
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:20,292
No, not here, not in my hearing,
you will not name him brother.

527
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:24,137
This son of the man who put your
true brothers to the sword.

528
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,619
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

529
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:28,145
I forget nothing.

530
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:30,138
I remember my brothers.

531
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:33,794
And I remember when my father was a king.

532
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:50,963
I see.

533
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:54,233
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

534
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,534
and he will make me King of
the Iron Islands once again.

535
00:35:57,654 --> 00:35:59,119
I will lead the attack myself.

536
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:00,342
Oh, you will?

537
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:03,454
I'm your son. Your only living heir.

538
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:04,948
Who else?

539
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,783
I told you to wait outside.

540
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:13,025
How did you get past the guards?

541
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,262
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

542
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:17,836
My dear.

543
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:25,063
- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.

544
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,911
This is a homecoming I'll
tell my grandchildren about.

545
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,161
She can't lead an attack.

546
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,119
And why not?

547
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:36,150
You're a woman.

548
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,367
You're the one in skirts.

549
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,984
This isn't Winterfell, boy.

550
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:42,054
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

551
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:44,743
after your new father killed him.

552
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:47,286
What's dead may never die.

553
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,075
The only night she's spent off these
islands has been spent on the sea.

554
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,540
She's commanded men. She's killed men.

555
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:59,185
She knows who she is.

556
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,783
No man gives me a crown.

557
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,559
I pay the iron price.

558
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:09,115
I will take my crown.

559
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,025
That is who I am.

560
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,506
That is who we have always been.

561
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:21,439
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

562
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,460
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

563
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:34,131
You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.

564
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:38,305
All these kings fighting for the throne
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

565
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,768
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

566
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:42,870
Because you're a smart gambler.

567
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,916
Stannis has proved himself in war.
Twice.

568
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,356
His baby brother has never
set foot on a battlefield.

569
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:51,656
Neither has the false king, Joffrey.

570
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,429
And yet, they both have larger armies.

571
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:54,922
Stannis has just begun the fight.

572
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:57,977
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

573
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:03,108
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.

574
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,424
Or more worthy of loyalty.

575
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:08,643
What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings.

576
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:10,421
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

577
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:11,984
You think I'm insulted?

578
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,333
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

579
00:38:15,744 --> 00:38:17,284
I don't sail for promises.

580
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:18,250
Of course you do.

581
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,200
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.

582
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:23,364
A promise that somewhere on the seas,

583
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,444
somebody's got some gold and
you can take it from them.

584
00:38:25,473 --> 00:38:26,855
That's a promise that always comes true.

585
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:27,682
As is mine.

586
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,128
You're not the young man, Salladhor.

587
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:34,030
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

588
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,135
Only the clever ones.

589
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:38,937
You want to spend your
last few years on the sea,

590
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:42,095
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Midanese silk merchants,

591
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:42,747
then go.

592
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:43,555
They're out there waiting for you.

593
00:38:44,251 --> 00:38:45,060
That's easy.

594
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:47,551
What I'm offering you is hard.

595
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,601
Come with me and plunder the
greatest city in Westeros.

596
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,033
You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
And the most famous.

597
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:59,573
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

598
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:03,587
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

599
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:04,419
It is.

600
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,784
- One thing, I want the queen.
- The queen?

601
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:09,674
Cersei, I want her.

602
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:12,289
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships,

603
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:14,649
and if we don't drown at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay,

604
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,766
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.

605
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:19,355
This war isn't about you.

606
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,945
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

607
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,825
I'm not going to rape her,
I'm going to fuck her.

608
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,411
As if she would just let you.

609
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,199
You don't know how persuasive I am.

610
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,337
I never tried to fuck you.

611
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:35,251
Stannis is the rightful king.

612
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:36,778
And the Lord of Light.

613
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:37,786
The one true god.

614
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:39,398
I've been all over the world, my boy,

615
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:42,086
and everywhere I go, people
tell me about the true god.

616
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,969
They all think they found the right one.

617
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:47,165
The one true god is what's
between a woman's legs,

618
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:49,307
and better yet a queen's legs.

619
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,182
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

620
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:54,344
He's young yet.

621
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,218
I promise you the gold.

622
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,355
I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.

623
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,005
You believe your king can win?

624
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,713
He is the one true king.

625
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:09,582
You Westerosers are funny people.

626
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:12,956
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

627
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:16,782
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

628
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:19,582
You are the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

629
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,652
Make me rich.

630
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:25,400
Get me to the gates of
King's Landing and I will.

631
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:38,685
When will the King have a sail?

632
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,618
As soon as his God wills it.

633
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,888
He's my God too, and yours...

634
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,132
but you were too blind to see.

635
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:50,006
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh you and your mother.

636
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:51,465
It won't take long you
already know the letters.

637
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,854
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

638
00:40:53,974 --> 00:40:55,418
I wish I had a God, truly!

639
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,950
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men

640
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,566
pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
pray for rain, pray for home,

641
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:03,013
- None of it works!
- But you always came home.

642
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,760
I wasn't praying, you know.

643
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:06,893
But I was.

644
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,820
Every night that you're at sea,

645
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,492
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

646
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:16,386
You want me to have a god, fine.

647
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:18,173
King Stannis is my god.

648
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,626
He raised me up and blessed
me with his trust.

649
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:22,158
He gave you a future

650
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,690
I could never have imagined.

651
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,585
You know how to read,
you'll be a knight someday.

652
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:28,437
You think your fire god commanded all that?

653
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:29,855
It was Stannis.

654
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,952
Only Stannis.

655
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:34,970
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

656
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,831
Don't tell him that.

657
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:41,398
Lord Janos Slynt was
Commander of the City Watch.

658
00:41:41,518 --> 00:41:42,912
You had no right to exile him.

659
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:44,705
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

660
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:47,143
You're serving as the King's
Hand until father gets here.

661
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:49,793
- I am Queen Regent.
- Listen to me, Queen Regent,

662
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:51,416
you're losing the people.

663
00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:54,476
- Do you hear me?
- The people?

664
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:56,226
You think I care?

665
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:59,627
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

666
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:04,523
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

667
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:08,258
And gold-plated foes
just gave them the rallying cry.

668
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,902
The Queen slaughters babies.

669
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,799
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

670
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:28,439
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

671
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:30,959
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

672
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,589
Did he tell you?

673
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:36,923
I imagine that would be even worse.

674
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:38,637
He did what needed to be done.

675
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:41,001
You want to be the Hand of the King?

676
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,168
You want to rule?

677
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:43,559
This is what ruling is!

678
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,123
Lying on a bed of weeds,

679
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:48,851
ripping them out by the root one by one
before they strangle you in your sleep.

680
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:51,187
I'm no king, but I think there's
more to ruling that that.

681
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,773
I don't care what you think!

682
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,748
You've never taken it seriously.

683
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,663
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

684
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:02,218
It's all fallen on me.

685
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,516
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

686
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:16,712
You're funny.

687
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:21,746
You've always been funny.

688
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:26,277
But none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

689
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,096
You remember...

690
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:34,365
Back when you ripped my mother open on
your way out of her and she bled to death.

691
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:37,913
She was my mother too.

692
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,720
Now they're gone,

693
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:43,727
for the sake of you.

694
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:48,905
There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.

695
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:13,279
Your Grace.
Your Grace.

696
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:15,507
How did it fare with your pirate?

697
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,655
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.

698
00:44:17,775 --> 00:44:20,394
30 ships, his men know how to fight.

699
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:23,938
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

700
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:27,885
- Does seem the wiser choice.
- It won't be a choice this time.

701
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,388
Do you trust him?

702
00:44:31,193 --> 00:44:34,039
Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
I've known him 30 years.

703
00:44:34,496 --> 00:44:36,160
I've never trusted him.

704
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:39,436
Now once he gets the smell
of gold, he never stops.

705
00:44:40,563 --> 00:44:42,980
Well if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

706
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:48,565
Leave us.

707
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:56,228
At once, Your Grace.

708
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:05,293
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

709
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:12,268
Come.

710
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:20,497
What did you say to him?

711
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,167
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

712
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,006
- Why?
- Because it is true.

713
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,055
You're troubled my king.

714
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:31,441
Yeah.

715
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:34,614
These armies are but toys
for the Lord of Light.

716
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:36,329
Tell your lord to burn them then.

717
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:38,708
I tell him nothing!

718
00:45:38,828 --> 00:45:41,822
I pray for his commands and I obey.

719
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:46,607
My little brother has a hundred
thousand men according to the scouts.

720
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,762
Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

721
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,926
- You must have faith.
- Faith?

722
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:59,182
In a real war, the side with the greater
number wins nine times out of ten.

723
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,069
Then we must be the ten.

724
00:46:01,189 --> 00:46:03,922
I cannot defeat my brother in the field,

725
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:07,698
and I can't take King's Landing
without the men he stole.

726
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:13,159
I have seen the path to
victory in the flames.

727
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,215
At first, you must give
yourself to the Lord of Light.

728
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:21,097
I've said the words, damn you.

729
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:26,053
I burnt the idols.

730
00:46:29,682 --> 00:46:32,782
You must give all of yourself.

731
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:39,541
I have a wife.

732
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:42,587
I took a vow.

733
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,779
She's sick.

734
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,387
Weak.

735
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:51,205
Shut away in the tower.

736
00:46:52,554 --> 00:46:53,958
She disgusts you.

737
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,520
And she's giving you nothing.

738
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:01,763
No sons.

739
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,617
Only stillborns.

740
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,586
Only death.

741
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:14,157
I will give you...

742
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,656
a son, my King.

743
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:20,759
A son?

744
00:49:52,373 --> 00:50:12,062
