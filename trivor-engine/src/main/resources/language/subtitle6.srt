1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,303
See that aspiring model there?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,138
C'est moi... Deb...
Jusqu'au jour de ma mort.

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,831
Je pensais aller droit au paradis,

4
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:10,333
mais il y a une erreur,

5
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:11,918
and I woke up in someone else's body.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,754
So now I'm Jane,

7
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:18,307
a super-busy lawyer
with my very own assistant.

8
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:20,476
I got a new life, a new wardrobe,

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,929
and the only people who really
know what's going on with me

10
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:26,015
are my girlfriend Stacy
and my guardian angel, Paul.

11
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,800
I used to think everything
happened for a reason.

12
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,436
- Whoo!
- Now, I sure hope I was right.

13
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:35,595
Drop Dead Diva 5x08 - 50 Shades of Grayson
Original air date August 11, 2013

15
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,821
Oh, no, no, seriously, I'm good.

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,939
I'm good.

17
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,660
- Stacy!
- Oh! Oh!

18
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,295
Oh, wow!

19
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:00,616
You must do like
a thousand push-ups every day.

20
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,585
Oh!

21
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,171
It's too close. It's too close!

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,261
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Emma!

23
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:13,012
Hi!

24
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:14,481
You should totally do a shot
on that blond's six pack.

25
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:16,966
- I will call him over.
- Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

26
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:19,135
But thanks, Stacy.

27
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,104
Can you believe
I'm getting married in two days?

28
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,856
No.

29
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:24,157
I shouldn't even be looking at them.

30
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:25,775
I know, but let's kind of look again.

31
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:30,113
Oh, this is Robert's best man
calling from the bachelor party.

32
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:31,481
Okay.

33
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,033
No, Stacy! Stace!

34
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,336
That's like your third shooter
in 10 minutes.

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,322
I'm about to be
artificially inseminated.

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,825
And this bachelorette party
is... it's like my last hurrah.

37
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:46,379
- Okay.
- Emma!

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,214
Who wants to strip naked

39
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:49,883
and jump into the neighbor's hot tub?!

40
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,553
Wow, are you okay?

41
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:55,838
Robert was arrested in San Diego.

42
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,559
I need to get down there, Jane.
He needs a lawyer.

43
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,683
I am furious. I'm devastated.
I am pissed to high hell!

44
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:09,852
Just slow down.
Start from the beginning.

45
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,524
When my husband lost his job,
we were in bad shape.

46
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,743
So I decided to publish a book online.

47
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,413
And at first, I was earning
almost $2,000 a month,

48
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:22,332
but now almost nothing.

49
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,917
And it's all because a best seller

50
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:27,036
ripped off my story line,
my characters... everything!

51
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:32,091
Look. Here's my book.

52
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:35,094
An Erotic Thriller."

53
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,430
I know what you're thinking.

54
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,731
But it paid the bills.

55
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,099
Last we spoke,

56
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:41,851
I thought you were writing
a serious novel.

57
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,686
Yeah, I couldn't find a publisher.

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,055
But they all complimented
on the one sex scene...

59
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:48,274
missionary in a yoga studio.

60
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:52,061
And that's when you decided
to write e-rom?

61
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:54,747
Erotic romance.

62
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,115
There's a huge market

63
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,034
for female-focused historical erotica.

64
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:01,204
"The Randy Baron" saved my family.

65
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,739
But then it got ripped off
by "The Naughty Earl."

66
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,576
Look.

67
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,381
With the marketing behind that book,

68
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:12,575
my book has become invisible.

69
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,766
They're really that similar?

70
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,604
Down to the mead-driven orgy
in the hedge maze.

71
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,856
Mmm! I've always
wanted to do it in a maze.

72
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:23,643
You're not alone. Women really
responded to my book.

73
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,779
Well, that's probably why
Elyse Hoffman copied you.

74
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:29,765
Cindy, we'll start working
on your case immediately.

75
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,908
Robert was having a blast.

76
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:40,326
We got drunk at the hotel

77
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:43,296
and decided to cross the border
into Tijuana.

78
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,831
- Always a smart decision.
- We were marinated in Tequila.

79
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,000
We weren't thinking straight.

80
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,835
What exactly happened to my fiancé?

81
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:50,753
When we were coming back to the U.S.,

82
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,955
we got separated
at the border-crossing station.

83
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:56,092
As his best man, I went to look for him

84
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,978
and found out he was arrested
for disorderly conduct.

85
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,963
Okay, I need to speak with Robert.

86
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,181
The marshal said he'll come get us

87
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,349
when he's in his holding cell.

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
- Holding cell?!
- No, no, no.

89
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,603
It's all fine.

90
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,105
Listen, you and Robert are going
to be married tomorrow night.

91
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,323
I promise.

92
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:11,807
Okay?

93
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:14,310
Anyone need caffeine?

94
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,147
- No, thank you.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

95
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,505
Ah, this court never has cream.

96
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,007
Which is why
I keep a stash in the fridge.

97
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,342
You never know when they'll
arrest a client at the border.

98
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,177
Thank you!

99
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,680
- I'm Luis.
- Jane.

100
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:34,997
You an immigration attorney?

101
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,466
Well, my office is in Long Beach,

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,468
but I practically live
in this courthouse.

103
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:40,470
- Ah!
- I am digging that outfit.

104
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:42,889
Especially the, uh, glitter in the hair.

105
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,890
Oh. Yeah.

106
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,692
I left a bachelorette party

107
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:48,544
to rescue a drunk bachelor
who got arrested at the border.

108
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,480
Happens every night.

109
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:51,875
You'll argue before judge Coleman,

110
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,182
and if your client
doesn't have a record,

111
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,317
he'll just be released with a fine.

112
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,986
Great. Thank you.

113
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,372
Excuse me. Jane? Robert's ready for us.

114
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:00,907
Okay. Thanks, again. Luis?

115
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,525
Yeah. No problem. I'll see you later.

116
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,526
I have an appearance
before the same judge, so...

117
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:06,079
Great.

118
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,531
Emma, I am so sorry.

119
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:11,718
You swore that the party
wouldn't get out of control.

120
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:13,419
What happened?

121
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,754
Honestly, I don't know.

122
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:17,206
Okay, Robert, what do you remember?

123
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,709
I was at the Hard Rock pounding shots,

124
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,211
and then I woke up in jail
with vomit on my shoes.

125
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,515
Everything in between is a blank.

126
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:28,067
Emma, please forgive me.

127
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:31,237
I can't wait to get married.

128
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,056
But right now I want to kill you.

129
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,733
You had an impressive second quarter.

130
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,234
Things are certainly up
since you've arrived.

131
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,403
I'm just part of a team, Mr. Tuttle.

132
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:50,123
- Ah. Meet my colleague.
- Ah, Ms. Kaswell.

133
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,791
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm late.

134
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,760
I was just with a client.

135
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,911
Not a problem. Clients should
always come first.

136
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:59,081
Spoken like a true
malpractice insurance adjustor.

137
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,801
Yes, and, uh, I'm sure you're both busy,

138
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:02,802
so I'll get down to it.

139
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,387
Mr. Parker has hired me

140
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,639
to make sure that the firm
is adequately protected.

141
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,943
I'll need access to all of
your employees and your records.

142
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,779
I'm sorry. W... will you excuse me
for a second?

143
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:14,230
Certainly.

144
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,984
I'll use the time
to speak with Ms. Kaswell.

145
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,233
Great.

146
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,572
So, Ms. Kaswell,

147
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,774
how long do you plan on
being out of commission?

148
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,576
Excuse me?

149
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,996
Maternity leave.
It's relevant to my assessment.

150
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,831
Oh.

151
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:36,002
Um, yeah, I plan to keep
my leave as short as possible.

152
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,638
Uh-huh.

153
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:44,310
I mean, I'm... I'm working on
my childcare plans right now.

154
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:46,179
I... I believe it, uh, takes a village.

155
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,463
A village?

156
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:52,151
Hmm. Got it.

157
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:58,024
Stacy, what's wrong?

158
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:59,942
Oh, nothing's wrong.

159
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,144
I brought gifts
in honor of your sperm donation.

160
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,313
- Boxers?
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:06,999
Well, Jane happened to mention
that you wear tighty whities,

162
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,117
- but...
- Huh.

163
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,535
...to maximize sperm motility,

164
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,120
you got to keep those fellas
free and cool.

165
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,205
Uh-huh.

166
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,706
Fertil-aid...

167
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:17,960
the selenium and zinc
increase sperm count.

168
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,797
Let me guess... super sperm water.

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,048
No, just regular water.

170
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,579
Don't take the pills without drinking.

171
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,167
I don't want you to choke.

172
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:27,837
Okay. Stacy, when exactly
will you be ovulating?

173
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,305
Any day now.

174
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,473
As soon as my ovulation stick
turns pink,

175
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,007
I will pick you up,

176
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,693
drive you to the clinic
at Roosevelt Hospital,

177
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,695
and you can make a fresh deposit.

178
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,530
Okay. I'll be ready.

179
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,649
- Okay!
- All right.

180
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,151
Excuse me.

181
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:45,154
I did some digging
on the "Randy Baron" case.

182
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,373
Now, according to Cindy's sales records,

183
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,708
her e-book was downloaded

184
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:49,709
by an executive at the publishing house.

185
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,193
Well, that's great.

186
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,545
It proves the publishing house
had access.

187
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,530
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

188
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,003
Nicole's stepping up.

189
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:02,371
I'm glad you've noticed.

190
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,940
You know, we only date where we work

191
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,775
when we're too busy
to seek it out elsewhere.

192
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,343
Says the woman who's expecting

193
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:09,262
the senior partner's baby any minute.

194
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:11,597
Says the woman who was dumped
by the senior partner

195
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:12,765
and speaks from experience.

196
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:15,184
Hey, Grayson, other than me,

197
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,853
does anyone else know
about the two of you?

198
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,855
No, we're being discreet.

199
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:21,357
Well, for what it's worth, be careful.

200
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,859
Don't hurt her.

201
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:26,412
What about me? I could get hurt.

202
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:30,666
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

203
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:35,755
Was my client sloppy-drunk? Yes.

204
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,573
I mean, we all know how guys
can be at bachelor parties.

205
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,075
But the disorderly-conduct
charge should be dropped.

206
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,745
My client has no prior record.

207
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,715
What does the United States
have to say on this?

208
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:48,050
Your Honor, the United States
is amending its complaint.

209
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:50,052
We are now charging Robert Medina

210
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:51,721
with false representation of citizenship

211
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:56,258
in violation
of 8 U.S. code section 12-27.

212
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,593
Excuse me. What?

213
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:59,428
Your client is not a U.S. citizen.

214
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,765
It's true. I... I moved to
the U.S. when I was an infant,

215
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,099
and I have a green card.

216
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:05,902
I don't even speak Spanish.

217
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,904
Okay, my client is a legal
resident. He has a green card.

218
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:08,938
The defendant was born in Mexico.

219
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:10,623
Your Honor, last night,

220
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,959
while trying to cross
back into the United States,

221
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,911
he went into the American-citizen line.

222
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:18,113
I call the court's attention
to the surveillance footage.

223
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,119
Okay, what is the problem?

224
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,638
His California driver's license
is valid.

225
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:27,974
So, Your Honor, as I mentioned earlier,

226
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:29,976
my client was really drunk.

227
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,144
Getting in the wrong line...
it was just...

228
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,479
it was just an innocent mistake.

229
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:35,815
The law prohibits the impersonation

230
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,650
of an American citizen
at a border crossing.

231
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,101
It...

232
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:41,654
I agree. I'm gonna
set this down for trial.

233
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,973
Uh, whoa!

234
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:46,976
Your Honor, my client is due
to be married in 36 hours.

235
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,495
I request an expedited hearing.

236
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,496
Fine, we'll reconvene after lunch.

237
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,321
- Ms. Bingum?
- Yeah?

238
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,123
I know you're in a rush,

239
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:03,960
but, uh...
If your client is found guilty,

240
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,462
the penalty is exclusion from the U.S.

241
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:07,964
for a minimum of five years.

242
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,966
Robert will be stuck in Mexico?

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,468
Yeah, that's right,
and, uh, I'm sorry to say,

244
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,149
but the odds are against you.

245
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:27,009
Oh, man. I love bachelor parties.

246
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,002
Getting so drunk
you can't remember anything?

247
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:30,454
What's the point?

248
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,506
If you have to ask,
you can't understand it.

249
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,041
Whose phone is this, anyway?

250
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,876
The best man's, whom I blame

251
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,345
for taking my client out of
the country in the first place.

252
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,013
Thank you for driving down, by the way.

253
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:42,966
I needed this change of clothes
in the worst way.

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,302
I listened to Beyoncé.
I flashed a few truckers.

255
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:46,636
Two hours flew by.

256
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,339
Now that I'm here, I thought
I might go to the beach.

257
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,340
Uh, no. Not so fast.

258
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,858
I need you to go through

259
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:52,976
the discovery
the A.U.S.A. just dumped on me.

260
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,013
Hey, I thought you angelinos
might be hungry.

261
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,817
- Gracias, señor.
- Thank you!

262
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,352
So the false-representation charge...

263
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,904
- Mm-hmm.
- ...It's based on

264
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,156
this federal statute
rarely enforced before 9/11,

265
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,658
but now the U.S. attorney's
office is using it

266
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,043
as this anti-immigration weapon.

267
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:12,829
Robert is a legal immigrant
with no record!

268
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:14,664
Yes, and having a clean record is key.

269
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:16,049
Be sure to tell the court

270
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,367
that Robert never meant
to misrepresent himself.

271
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:20,036
- Okay.
- Oh, and it wouldn't hurt

272
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,338
to compliment judge Coleman's watch.

273
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:23,724
Why his watch?

274
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:26,059
His brother makes these
handcrafted watch bands.

275
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,545
He could talk about it for hours.

276
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,400
Thank you for helping my wife.

277
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,051
Her book... it... it really saved us.

278
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,404
Don't worry, Howard.
We're gonna make this right.

279
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,655
All rise.

280
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,393
Be seated.

281
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,911
- Ms. Kaswell.
- Yes.

282
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,030
Your Honor, we'd like to introduce

283
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:48,532
as plaintiff's exhibit "A,"

284
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,701
a sales report from my client's company.

285
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:55,038
On may 5th, a credit card
owned by Jamie Levit

286
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:56,706
was used to purchase my client's book.

287
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,543
Ms. Levit is an editor
with the Hudson Lake Press,

288
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,911
which proves
they had access to her book.

289
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,580
Just because
an employee purchased the book

290
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,049
doesn't prove Elyse Hoffman copied it.

291
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,219
Correct, which is why we
need to hear from Ms. Hoffman.

292
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,087
Elyse Hoffman is actually here.

293
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,923
I'm I'm sorry. What?

294
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,259
Hudson Lake Press is Elyse Hoffman.

295
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,562
You want to explain that?

296
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:20,280
My client uses a team of writers

297
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:24,234
to compose their erotic fiction,
but even if we admit to access,

298
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:27,604
the standard for a plagiarism
claim is substantial similarity.

299
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,122
We are not stipulating to that.

300
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:31,458
She's right, Ms. Kaswell.

301
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,627
And the burden of proof is on you.

302
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,751
Well, thank you for noticing,
Ms. Bingum.

303
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,087
These bands also come in women's styles,

304
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,423
and they're available
in a shop across the street.

305
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,258
Well, I will have to buy me a few

306
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,960
before heading back to L.A.,
which I'm hoping will be today,

307
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,963
as there's no reason
to further detain my client,

308
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,432
a respected businessman

309
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:58,151
who never intended
to misrepresent himself.

310
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,271
Very well. Does the government
wish to add anything?

311
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,689
Yes, Your Honor.

312
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,442
Based on recent information,
we are proceeding

313
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,644
with additional criminal charges
against the defendant.

314
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,497
- What?!
- Solicitation of a prostitute

315
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,782
at the San Diego Hard Rock Hotel

316
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,318
yesterday, prior to visiting Mexico.

317
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,654
The San Diego P.D. just sent my office

318
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:22,158
a credit-card receipt
for a "happy massage."

319
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,497
- Even if that's true...
- It's not true.

320
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,633
Even if the allegations are true,

321
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,017
it's only a misdemeanor.

322
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,520
It's also a crime of moral turpitude,

323
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,522
and any person
convicted of such a crime,

324
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,691
if found guilty of false representation,

325
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:40,727
faces a 10-year exclusion
from the United States.

326
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,515
I'm sorry, Ms. Bingum,
but these proceedings are stayed

327
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,985
pending the outcome
of this solicitation charge,

328
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,570
which I will hear this afternoon.

329
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:59,663
So you have no memory of using
your credit card at 11:03 P.M.

330
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:01,715
To pay for a Tina Lassider's
massage service?

331
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,719
I... I don't remember anything.

332
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:07,704
But I would never cheat on Emma.

333
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,872
How can you not remember?

334
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,842
No matter how much I drank,
I would never cheat on you.

335
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,178
Can I come in?

336
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,514
Yeah.

337
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,182
Robert's innocent.

338
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:21,518
He didn't hire the prostitute.

339
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:22,652
I did.

340
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,239
I... I used your credit card
while you were passed out.

341
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:27,724
Son of a bitch!

342
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,277
I was really wasted, which is no excuse.

343
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:33,446
I'm so sorry, dude.

344
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:45,041
Let's talk about Jane Bingum.

345
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,243
What about Jane?

346
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,379
From what I've heard,
she's a trial phenom.

347
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:50,931
She is an asset to the firm.

348
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:54,100
Mr. French, why did you join
Harrison & Parker?

349
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,386
I mean, you could have made more
at a larger place.

350
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,254
Cut to the chase, Tuttle.

351
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,889
I think you came here for Jane.

352
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:02,392
How is that relevant?

353
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,893
Now that you're no longer together,

354
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,228
I'd like to know
if you plan on sticking around.

355
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:07,447
We were over before I joined the firm.

356
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:08,765
Perhaps you're hoping to win her back.

357
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,066
No. No, that's not the case.

358
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,818
You're a tremendous litigator.

359
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,287
Why don't you try to convince me
that you don't want Jane back.

360
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:15,438
Mr. Tuttle.

361
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:19,075
You need to know
if I'm staying with the firm

362
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,777
because if I left,
it would affect our insurance.

363
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,779
I'm telling you without hesitation

364
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,113
I'm not going anywhere.

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,134
My client's best man
hired the prostitute,

366
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,419
and he is willing to plead guilty.

367
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,004
I'll even go to jail.

368
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,257
Robert is innocent. I swear.
And I don't believe you.

369
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,142
This isn't the first time
a well-intentioned friend

370
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:39,429
offered to take the heat for
someone facing a harsh penalty,

371
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:40,597
such as deportation.

372
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,182
The immigration charge

373
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,650
should have no bearing
on how you handle this case.

374
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,602
I won't drop the charges
against your client,

375
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,487
but I will offer him a deal...

376
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,440
no jail time
in exchange for a guilty plea.

377
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:54,778
Well, unfortunately,
we can't take that deal.

378
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,480
Solicitation gets my client deported.

379
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,867
Then I have no choice.
I'll see you in court.

380
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,485
We went into the suite's bedroom,

381
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:15,880
and I ran his card
on my phone's payment app.

382
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,717
$250 is my rate for bobbing for apples,

383
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:19,884
if you know what I mean.

384
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,519
I believe I do.

385
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,688
No further questions.

386
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,707
Ms. Lassider, after you left the hotel,

387
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,158
weren't you arrested for...

388
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:29,828
"Bobbing for apples"
with a different man

389
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,996
three hours after you claimed
you "bobbed" with my client?

390
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,834
Yeah. They busted us in his prius.

391
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,552
And yet you aren't being charged

392
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:40,672
for any crimes that night,
as part of your immunity deal.

393
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:42,307
Yeah, but I'm telling the truth.

394
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,259
Credit cards don't lie.

395
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,212
Um...

396
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,516
You know what, you're right.
Credit cards don't lie.

397
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,018
People's exhibit 3...

398
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:58,740
your credit-card receipt
complete with time... 11:03 P.M.

399
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:00,692
That's relevant why?

400
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:03,695
I would like to introduce into evidence

401
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:08,249
defendant's exhibit 7 and 8...

402
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:09,584
time-stamped photographs of my client

403
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,202
taken the night of the alleged crime.

404
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,754
Tina, those photographs show

405
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,539
that my client
was passed out at 10:48 P.M.

406
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:20,244
And still passed out at 11:22 P.M.

407
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:23,414
I imagine the hotel room was dark.

408
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:26,918
Could you have "bobbed"
for someone else's apple

409
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,721
and confused him for my client?

410
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:31,723
That's the guy. If it helps,

411
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:34,359
I remember he was wearing
blue boxer briefs.

412
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:38,262
Blue boxer briefs?

413
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:43,267
I... I find it interesting because
when my client was arrested,

414
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,269
he was wearing plaid boxers,

415
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,573
as noted in defendant's exhibit 4...

416
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,074
the federal intake report.

417
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,443
At this time, I would like to ask Keith,

418
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:55,446
Robert's best man, to please stand up.

419
00:17:56,966 --> 00:18:01,169
What color and style
of underwear do you wear?

420
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:05,623
See for yourself.

421
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:11,346
Blue boxer briefs.

422
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,767
I move to dismiss
all charges against my client.

423
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,602
Motion granted. This case is dismissed.

424
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,270
We are done for the day.

425
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:21,272
Your Honor, what about
the false-representation charge?

426
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:22,941
My docket's full.

427
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:25,610
Soonest I'd be able to hear this
is two weeks.

428
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:26,861
No. No, no, no.

429
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:27,996
See, my client's
getting married tomorrow.

430
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,981
There's nothing I can do.

431
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,316
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor?

432
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,318
I believe I have an at-liberty defendant

433
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,987
scheduled to appear before you
tomorrow morning.

434
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:37,655
I'd be delighted to adjourn that matter

435
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,657
in order to clear time
for Ms. Bingum's case.

436
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,295
Works for me.
We're adjourned till tomorrow.

437
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:51,135
Thank you so much.
How can I ever repay you?

438
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,438
Um, have dinner with me tonight?

439
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,010
- Okay.
- Okay.

440
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:04,482
Professor Sharf,
you have a PHD in literature

441
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,150
from Stanford University?

442
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:07,819
That's correct.

443
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,353
And you've read both the novel
and the online book.

444
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:10,822
Every page.

445
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,708
Did you find them to be
substantially similar?

446
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,026
Yes.

447
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,861
Uh, characters, tone, scene structure,

448
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,213
even the basic plot.

449
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,364
And how do you explain that?

450
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,750
Whoever wrote "The Naughty Earl"

451
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,504
first read "The Randy Baron"
and copied it.

452
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,006
Nothing further.

453
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,008
Professor Sharf, are you familiar with

454
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:32,710
the software program
called Plagiarismnet?

455
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:36,397
Yes. It's the gold standard
to prove plagiarism.

456
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:39,901
I'd like to introduce into
evidence a Plagiarismnet report

457
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:42,520
comparing "The Naughty Earl"
to "The Randy Baron."

458
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:44,355
- Objection.
- Your Honor, Ms. Kaswell

459
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:47,075
can produce 100 experts
who will say that

460
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,077
these two books
are substantially similar.

461
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,062
I can produce 100 more
that say they're not.

462
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,414
We contend that this software

463
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,783
is an objective way
to provide the truth.

464
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:58,703
The objection is overruled.

465
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:01,238
Professor, I have the results

466
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:05,242
of a Plagiarismnet comparison
of these two novels.

467
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:08,579
Could you please read the results?

468
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:12,600
The report shows a score of 41%.

469
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,219
Can you explain what that means?

470
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,106
It means there's a 41% chance
that the work was plagiarized.

471
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,942
The burden of proof for the plaintiff

472
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:22,760
is a preponderance of the evidence.

473
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:25,396
If there's only a 41% chance
that the work was plagiarized,

474
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,231
you need to side with my client.

475
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,599
Well, hold on.

476
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,234
We request time to review the report.

477
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,153
You have one night.

478
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,627
- Dinner was delicious.
- Yeah.

479
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:41,296
Oh, and I loved that story
about your roommate.

480
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,630
Oh, well, it's totally true.

481
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:43,798
I mean, she created a business

482
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,416
out of half a pie and half a cake.

483
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,168
Amazing.

484
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:56,460
All right, Luis,
so tell me all your secrets.

485
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:58,146
How do I win my case? You stay on point.

486
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,814
The law wasn't meant

487
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:00,982
to keep good people like Robert
out of the country.

488
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,800
You know, I'm free tomorrow morning

489
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,986
if you'd like for me to sit in
as your unofficial second chair?

490
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,157
Yeah! Your stature could really
help out with the judge.

491
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,826
Thank you.

492
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,494
Okay.

493
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,831
Enough shop talk. Tell me about you.

494
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:21,002
Uh, well, there's...
there's not much to tell.

495
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:23,154
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

496
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,793
Jane, you realize that Long Beach

497
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:29,844
isn't that far from L.A.

498
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:33,131
Oh.

499
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,799
Oh. Um...

500
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,502
I'm not really in a...
in a place for... for dating.

501
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,004
Oh. You're seeing someone.

502
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:42,506
- Well, not exactly. It's...
- No?

503
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:48,780
Mm!

504
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,850
Oh.

505
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:53,985
You know what? I think I'm gonna go.

506
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,186
- Is that okay?
- I'm sorry.

507
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm fine. It's gonna be fine.

508
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:57,405
- Yeah? I'll see you.
- Okay.

509
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:58,656
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

510
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,874
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

511
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,743
Hi.

512
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,413
Can I go to the beach?

513
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,215
I thought you said that
asians don't like the beach.

514
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,384
They don't like the sun,
but I like the surfers.

515
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,220
What are you looking at?
The video of Robert's arrest.

516
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,056
It's 15 seconds long.
Can you go to immigration?

517
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,559
Ask if they have anything
that came before or after it?

518
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,144
- Sure.
- Thanks.

519
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,930
But first, is there
anything you want to tell me?

520
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:32,249
Rumor has it you were
chowing on pasta primavera

521
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,917
with a charming Latin lawyer.

522
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,502
Well, that's true.

523
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:39,623
- And he kissed me.
- Jane Bingum, I'm impressed.

524
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:43,627
Luis is smart,
and passionate, and single,

525
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,128
and I felt absolutely nothing.

526
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,764
I'm serious, not even a flutter.

527
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,965
When we get back to L.A.,

528
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,601
I'm gonna set you up
with my sex therapist.

529
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,853
Maybe you need to open up
your sex chakra.

530
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,855
No. I think my sex chakra's fine.

531
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,940
Look, we both know what's going on here.

532
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:59,443
The question is
what are you gonna do about it?

533
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,611
This is about Grayson.

534
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,279
It's always been about Grayson.

535
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:05,082
It's always gonna be about Grayson.

536
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,154
I love him, Teri.

537
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:14,041
Finally. You said it out loud.

538
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,795
Now, why are you telling me and not him?

539
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,830
Well...

540
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:23,050
Emma, you okay?

541
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,770
- I'll follow up on that video.
- Thanks.

542
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,675
If Robert can't go back
to the United States, I'll die.

543
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,977
- Emma.
- I love him so much.

544
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:36,680
I know it sounds sappy,

545
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,982
but the minute I met him,
I knew we'd be married.

546
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:42,152
I knew we'd be together forever.

547
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,072
And now I just...
I can't bear the thought that...

548
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,826
My mother is sick.

549
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,161
She lives with us,
and I take care of her.

550
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:55,332
If Robert gets stuck in Mexico,
I can't just go with him.

551
00:23:55,366 --> 00:24:00,087
Please tell me that we're gonna win.

552
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:09,179
Well, can't you challenge
the Plagiarismnet report?

553
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:10,681
We won't prevail. It's been
independently verified.

554
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,182
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:16,103
Look, Cindy... this might
not bring much solace,

556
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,772
but I've read your e-rom,
and you have talent.

557
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:22,225
Don't let those thieves dissuade
you from writing another book.

558
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:26,363
You don't understand.
My book is personal.

559
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,532
You lost me.

560
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,117
It sounds crazy, I know.

561
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,203
But my book is based on
my life with Howard.

562
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,205
I changed the names.

563
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,757
I changed the settings

564
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,292
and obviously put it
in a different time period,

565
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:43,413
but all of those scenes...
Howard and I lived them.

566
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,917
Look, Kim, the only way

567
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,969
that I was able to
write that book so quickly

568
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,722
is because it is inspired by my life.

569
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,256
Can you prove it?

570
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:56,026
Yeah, I... I kept a journal.

571
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,981
Cindy, we're going back to court.

572
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,985
Stacy.

573
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,321
Hey. Uh, what are you doing here?

574
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,324
I'm pink. I... I mean,
my ovulation stick is pink.

575
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,993
- I'm ovulating!
- Oh! Okay. Uh, great.

576
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,578
I'll... I'll go to the clinic
right after work.

577
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:15,963
No, no, we need to go now.

578
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,497
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. I can't.

579
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,166
I... I have a new-client meeting at 2:00,

580
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,251
and I... I abso... what is that?

581
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:22,669
Well, if you can't go to the clinic,

582
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,754
I'll bring the clinic to you.

583
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,291
Uh, where exactly am
I supposed to go to fill this?

584
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,293
There's a bathroom down the hall.

585
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:31,979
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,966
Oh, I also... I bought you
a magazine for inspiration.

587
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,235
The girl on the cover has lovely skin.

588
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:43,273
So, I'll be downstairs
getting frozen yogurt,

589
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,275
and you just give me a call
when the deed is done.

590
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:53,784
I hope I didn't offend you.

591
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,702
Clearly, I misread the situation.

592
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:57,204
Oh, no offense taken.

593
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:01,041
United States v. Robert Medina.

594
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,627
And we are back in session.

595
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,395
As you are aware,

596
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,697
my client has been cleared of
the state's solicitation charge,

597
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,015
and given that he has no record...

598
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,800
This statute is being used as a weapon

599
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,636
to victimize innocent,
law-abiding legal residents.

600
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,638
- Uh, Luis, please let me finish.
- The A.U.S.A.'s targeting

601
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,023
certain groups under orders
from their Washington superiors

602
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,841
who have an anti-immigration
agenda, and I...

603
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,978
Whoa! I am not alleging
anything like that.

604
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,646
Can we get back to discussing
my client's lack of intent?

605
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,982
Sit down!

606
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,566
Mr. Vega, are you suggesting that

607
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,652
I'm part of some
anti-immigration witch hunt?

608
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:29,820
- No!
- Yes!

609
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,071
I object!

610
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,689
You can't object to your co-counsel.

611
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,991
You're on the same side.

612
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,492
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

613
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,860
Counsel is seeking to use this case

614
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:39,663
to grandstand for political purposes.

615
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,198
And now we are asking for

616
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,668
a lifetime of exclusion
from the United States.

617
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,004
Your Honor, a recess, please.

618
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,538
30 minutes.

619
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,843
How dare you!

620
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,879
Hijacking my case
to set up a federal appeal?!

621
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,098
We need to get this statute overturned.

622
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,716
It is not being used
to keep out illegal aliens,

623
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:02,185
but rather to deport
legal residents like Robert,

624
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,720
who simply walked on to the wrong line!

625
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:06,857
I am sympathetic, but my objective

626
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,526
is to free my client
in time for his wedding!

627
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,695
I'm not here to change federal law!

628
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:14,064
Robert's a perfect case for appeal.

629
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,732
I mean, under this law, he could
end up in some foreign country

630
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,201
where he doesn't even
speak the language!

631
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,287
Yeah. That's why I'm trying to
keep him from getting deported.

632
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,956
Good luck with your crusade.

633
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:26,460
But please, stay away from my client...

634
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,911
and me.

635
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,383
Uh, Your Honor, before you rule,

636
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,086
we are amending our complaint
to add a conversion claim,

637
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:37,888
as we can prove that Hudson Lake Press

638
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,640
interfered with our client's
ownership of her life rights.

639
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,393
There are no life rights in this case.

640
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:47,397
My client's e-book is based on her...

641
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,983
rather adventurous sex life.

642
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:55,605
Howard, please stand.

643
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:02,278
Your Honor, Howard Kasper
is the Lord of Sussex,

644
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:05,916
the Randy Baron,
and Cindy is his mistress,

645
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,218
the Countess of Chestny, Lady Climoria.

646
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:10,971
You've got to be kidding.

647
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,506
Oh, I would never kid about sex.

648
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,424
We'd like to introduce into evidence

649
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,760
plaintiff's exhibit 11...
Cindy Kasper's journal.

650
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:19,596
We need time to read the journal.

651
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,965
We'll resume in one hour.

652
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,940
Owen? Owen, listen to me!

653
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,943
I was wrong.
The egg is not in the basket.

654
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:37,781
Keep the fish in the pond.
Fish in the pond!

655
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,033
Why are you screaming about fish?

656
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:44,154
I was... buying an aquarium.

657
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,792
Is Owen in there?

658
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:55,682
He's behind you.

659
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,138
Thank you.

660
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,006
Owen.

661
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:04,641
Please tell me you haven't.

662
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,009
I haven't.

663
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,395
Are we talking about the same thing?

664
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,730
I tried. Twice.

665
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,898
I can't do it at work.

666
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,984
Thank God. I'm not ovulating.

667
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,236
You said the stick was pink.

668
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,822
Actually, I was wearing
my new rose-tinted sunglasses,

669
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,657
and I misread the stick.

670
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,492
Sorry about the false alarm.

671
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,411
You know what? You can have this back.

672
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,879
- Oh.
- If we're gonna do this,

673
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,553
we're gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

674
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,333
No, no, no!

675
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,002
In a small, windowless room in
a hospital's fertility clinic.

676
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,753
Mm-hmm.

677
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,705
Hey, Teri. I got your text.

678
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:38,008
Talk fast.
I'm due back in court in five.

679
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,676
I thought you'd want to see this.

680
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,894
Good! Yes! The additional
footage from immigration.

681
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,379
- No, not from immigration.
- Okay.

682
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:46,216
U.S. immigration only had the 15 seconds

683
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,518
the A.U.S.A. supplied at discovery.

684
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,053
But borders have two sides.

685
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,555
You got footage from Mexico?

686
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:55,725
My ex-boy toy Manuel has
a cousin at the consulate.

687
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,161
- Check this out.
- Okay.

688
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,616
- And now we know when he puked.
- Okay.

689
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,117
I'm failing to see the relevance.

690
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:06,920
Stay focused, Jane. Watch this.

691
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,042
Wait a minute.

692
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,544
He did not intentionally walk
into that U.S. citizen's line.

693
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,546
He was guided there.

694
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,547
Ahh!

695
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:18,882
I thought you'd be happy.

696
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,383
Can I go flirt with surfers now?

697
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,969
I bought a big straw hat
and Margarita shaker.

698
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,471
Yes, Teri. Go.

699
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,808
I am gonna get my client to his wedding.

700
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,470
Mrs. Kasper, as I understand it,

701
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:41,273
chapter 7 of your online book
is based on a swinger party

702
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,275
you and your husband attended
in Van Nuys?

703
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:45,360
That's true.

704
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,330
Can you please read
the highlighted journal entry?

705
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:53,452
"I brought a casserole
to the Bosnak housewarming,"

706
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:56,621
"and the next thing I knew,
the caterers were naked,"

707
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,290
"and we were in the middle of an orgy"

708
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,825
"in their converted garage."

709
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:04,329
Grayson, will you please read
the first few lines of chapter 7

710
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,715
of Cindy's online book,
"The Randy Baron"?

711
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,551
"I brought a welsh pudding
to the Vickford's new manor."

712
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:13,638
"Our garments were torn from us
by their scantily clad servants"

713
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,507
"as we were thrown into
the most splendid of orgies"

714
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,176
"in the smoking room."

715
00:31:18,194 --> 00:31:22,180
Cindy, regarding
the Bosnak casserole party,

716
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:24,649
how does your journal entry conclude?

717
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,235
"I was incredibly turned on,"

718
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,154
"especially when Stanley Bosnak
picked me up"

719
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:32,157
"and lifted me onto his body."

720
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:36,361
"To think, I was worried
my casserole wouldn't go over."

721
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:39,498
Grayson, the, uh... the last few lines

722
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:42,000
of the Welsh pudding party, please.

723
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,035
"My lady pot was dripping with desire"

724
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:49,207
"as the Squire lifted me
upon his throbbing kingdom."

725
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:51,543
"To think, only that morn"

726
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:53,762
"I worried my welsh pudding
had chiggers."

727
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:59,384
Your Honor, obviously,
the correlation is, uh... um...

728
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:02,938
The correlation is... um...

729
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:04,689
Ohh!

730
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,224
You okay?

731
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:09,194
- Ms. Kaswell?
- I'm so sorry.

732
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,529
It appears, um... my water just broke.

733
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:12,063
But let's move on.

734
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:15,534
Um, Cindy, please read
your next journal entry

735
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,035
regarding the Jacobsen key party.

736
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,070
- Kim, you're in labor.
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

737
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,206
I'm fine. Just... just read it.

738
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,541
Ms. Kaswell,
I think we'd better adjourn.

739
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:23,959
Do you need medical assistance?

740
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,410
I don't... I don't think so.
No, not yet.

741
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:27,212
I just will request a 30-minute recess,

742
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,548
and then I'd like
to jump right to my closing.

743
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,716
You're having a baby.

744
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,585
I'm fine, really.

745
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,387
30 minutes... if you're available.

746
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:39,357
- But right now you need to go.
- Okay. Thank you.

747
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,157
My client did not intend
to get into the wrong line.

748
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,909
He was placed there by
a well-meaning Mexican official.

749
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,829
We never received this footage.

750
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,780
Oh, well, that's 'cause
you never asked for it.

751
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,250
It's from the Mexican consulate.

752
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,753
Judge, I am so sorry.

753
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:12,290
The footage is indisputable.
The defendant shall be released.

754
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:27,439
Now, one final point, Your Honor.

755
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,857
Go ahead, Ms. Kaswell.

756
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,642
And for the record,
I only agreed to this

757
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,527
so I wouldn't have to argue with you.

758
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,197
Sorry. Sorry.

759
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:37,032
One... one second!

760
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,455
Ohh!

761
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,156
Sorry.

762
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,210
The standard of proof for conversion

763
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:50,879
is also a preponderance of the evidence.

764
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,548
Based on my client's testimony,
as well as her journal,

765
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,800
it's clear that we've met that burden!

766
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,136
I agree. I find for the plaintiff.

767
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,804
- Aah!
- Whoo!

768
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,891
Now go, please. Have that baby.

769
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:04,008
Thanks, Kim!

770
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:07,479
Ohh. You're welcome.

771
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:11,032
Now get me the damn epidural!

772
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:18,240
Oh, you look beautiful!

773
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,574
Well, so do you!

774
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,693
I love getting ready for weddings.

775
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,579
Although I will say this one
took a little too much effort.

776
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,365
So I want to know more
about the hot lawyer.

777
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:28,866
He kissed you, and you felt nothing?

778
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:30,535
Zero.

779
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:33,255
But nobody could make me
feel anything except...

780
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,039
Grayson.

781
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,208
Yeah.

782
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:38,343
You know, the whole time
I was in San Diego,

783
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,928
I thought about him.

784
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,212
Because you love him
and you should be with him.

785
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,382
- What is that?
- Uh, it's my timer.

786
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,568
I set my phone to ring every three hours

787
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:48,186
to remind me to pee on a stick.

788
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,437
Excuse me.

789
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,889
That's me.

790
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,278
Hey.

791
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:58,113
Okay.

792
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,282
Yes.

793
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,617
That's great news.

794
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,901
Okay. Bye.

795
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,537
Stace.

796
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,071
Kim is at Roosevelt Hospital.

797
00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:08,707
She just had her baby.

798
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,408
- She had a boy.
- Ohh!

799
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,077
That's awesome! Let's go.

800
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:15,246
You want to visit Kim?

801
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:16,715
I need to meet Owen there.

802
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:18,383
The fertility clinic
is on the third floor,

803
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,552
and I'm officially ovulating.

804
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,054
Okay.

805
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,556
All right, here we go.

806
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:34,282
Congratulations!

807
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:36,735
Hey. I thought you were in San Diego.

808
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,903
I just got back.

809
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,405
For the baby.

810
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,574
Ohh.

811
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,909
Let me guess. There must be
a sale at the gift shop.

812
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,578
Uh...

813
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,913
Grayson got me that one.

814
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:51,750
Well, it was between that or spongebob.

815
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,753
Is Grayson still here?

816
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:57,121
Yeah, he, um... he went to see
the baby in the nursery.

817
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,507
They took him away so I could sleep,

818
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,760
but, uh... I miss him already.

819
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,629
You look pretty.

820
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,130
Uh, thank you.

821
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:07,932
I'm going to a wedding.

822
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,770
And you came by to see me? Thank you.

823
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:13,938
Oh, sure.

824
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:18,526
Well, I'm also here because
Stacy is getting inseminated.

825
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:20,028
Oh. Eee!

826
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,197
Oh, well, uh, two birds, one stone.

827
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:23,331
How efficient.

828
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:24,866
Yeah.

829
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:28,119
Oh. That's actually Stacy.
She wants to see me.

830
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,622
But congratulations again, Kim.

831
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:31,673
Thank you.

832
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,678
I'm really gonna miss you!

833
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:38,847
What?

834
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:41,016
I don't know why I said that.
I'm obviously still hormonal.

835
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,184
Okay.

836
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:45,136
It's okay, Kim.

837
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,307
Just... just go home and...
and enjoy that baby.

838
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,809
You'll hold down the fort?

839
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:52,310
Oh, believe me, all the chaos

840
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,312
will still be here when you get back.

841
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:58,149
Thanks, Jane.

842
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,736
- Bye.
- Bye.

843
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,495
- Hey.
- Hey.

844
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:14,215
Um, I just heard from Stacy.

845
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,168
I assume you did your part?

846
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,170
- You assume correctly.
- Okay.

847
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,755
Uh, she's got to stay in there

848
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,340
for like another half-hour or so.

849
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,509
How did San Diego go?
Did you save the groom?

850
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,227
I did, yes.

851
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:28,680
Actually, Emma should be walking
down the aisle right about now.

852
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,231
- Good work.
- Thanks.

853
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,019
Well, I'll see you later.

854
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

855
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,858
- Bye.
- Bye.

856
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:42,193
Uh, Mr. French.

857
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,587
If you don't mind, I'd like
a word with you and Ms. Kaswell.

858
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,952
Uh, of course.

859
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:55,290
Thank you, Mr. Tuttle,
but why are you here?

860
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,292
Well, I hadn't planned to
tell you this in the hospital,

861
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,426
but it can't wait.

862
00:37:58,461 --> 00:37:59,744
What can't wait?

863
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,579
My purpose in evaluating the firm

864
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,648
wasn't for malpractice insurance.

865
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,484
It was to appraise it... for a sale.

866
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,052
What?

867
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,721
Wait, hold on. Parker wants a buyout?

868
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,222
He's making a new life for himself,

869
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,475
and he wants an accurate
evaluation of the firm.

870
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,811
It's all here
in the notice of dissolution.

871
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,942
Harrison & Parker will be sold
to the highest bidder.

872
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,819
Congratulations on the baby.

873
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,964
- Uh...
- Hmm!

874
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,916
I hate that you look good
from every angle.

875
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,502
I need to keep my legs up
for another 20 minutes.

876
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:43,755
I can't believe I could actually
be getting pregnant right now.

877
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,423
I'm thinking positive thoughts for you.

878
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,926
Thank you.
And I'm doing the same for you.

879
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,261
Why me?

880
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,180
Well, for you and Grayson.

881
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:56,100
I mean, Jane, he's crazy about you.

882
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,269
And as far as I'm concerned,

883
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,605
any day you're not with him
is a wasted day.

884
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,108
I mean, take it from someone
who loves and respects you.

885
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:07,278
You need to go to him
and tell him how you feel.

886
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,863
But...

887
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:11,416
Mnh-mnh. Stop with the excuses.

888
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:14,652
The man told you he loves you,

889
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,487
and the only reason
you didn't say it back

890
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,373
is because you were consumed with guilt.

891
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,794
Jane, do you know where he is right now?

892
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,464
Yes, he went to the nursery
to see Kim's baby.

893
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,300
So you need to go to him.

894
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,637
Life is too short.
Don't waste another minute.

895
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:36,140
You of all people should know this.

896
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,560
Okay.

897
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,149
Okay.

898
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,534
Okay.

899
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:50,238
I'm really gonna do this, you know.

900
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:55,026
Thank you.

901
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:09,757
Hello, there.

902
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,759
Hey.

903
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,262
Oh, he is so cute.

904
00:40:14,313 --> 00:40:17,599
Yeah. Look at those tiny hands.

905
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,553
"Every child begins the world again."

906
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,389
Henry David Thoreau.

907
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,528
"Burp 'em once, then burp 'em again."

908
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,947
My grandma Ruth.

909
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,704
What about you, Grayson?

910
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,923
Do you want kids?

911
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:45,260
Enough for a basketball team.

912
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:46,377
How about you?

913
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,213
Absolutely...

914
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,215
Oh, yeah?

915
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,917
...as soon as I find the right guy.
