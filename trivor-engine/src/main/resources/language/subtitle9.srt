1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,485
She eats toast.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,271
I don't eat toast.

3
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,707
Do you eat breakfast every day?

4
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,991
I ate an apple.

5
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,493
They did not eat breakfast.

6
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,130
Did you eat the chocolate?

7
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:11,702
I will eat later.

8
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,911
We won't eat anything tonight.

9
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,210
What will you eat for lunch?

10
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,355
I've eaten breakfast.

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,956
- We haven't eaten yet.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,292
What have you eaten today?

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,295
She's eating toast.

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,243
We are not eating at home.

15
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,120
Is he eating now?

16
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,081
Yeah, sure.

17
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,417
Why not?

18
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,085
Perfect.
