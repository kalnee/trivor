1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,485
Oh, boy. Lots to catch up on.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,271
We'll start with the basics.

3
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,707
Jane was accidentally

4
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,991
artificially inseminated

5
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,493
with Rafael's sample.

6
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,130
Oh, and the doctor who inseminated her?

7
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:11,702
Well, that was his sister, Luisa.

8
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,911
They'd fall in love.

9
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,210
But happily ever after?
Not by a long shot.

10
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,355
For one, Jane's ex-fiancé Michael

11
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:20,802
is a detective, and he's
made a shocking discovery.

12
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,082
Rafael told us the bellboy's last words

13
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,418
were "Sin Rostro"

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,153
he wasn't naming his killer,

15
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:27,754
he was identifying her.

16
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,396
Rafael's stepmother, Rose, is Sin Rostro,

17
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,538
the big, bad criminal he's been after.

18
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,509
Oh...

19
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,577
And she killed his father.

20
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:39,597
But Rafael doesn't know that... yet.

21
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:42,734
Meanwhile, Luisa was sleeping with Rose.

22
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:44,103
We still have to tell my father

23
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:45,906
- what happened between us.
- What?

24
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,213
My shaman thinks it's really important

25
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,684
for me to just come clean.

26
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:50,718
So Rose had her committed.

27
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,890
You're having some sort of episode.

28
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,993
- Fantasizing...
- Stop lying!

29
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:57,260
Oh, and even more scandalous,

30
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:59,767
remember Roman Zazo, who was impaled?

31
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,336
Did everything go okay?

32
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:03,006
Yeah.

33
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:05,708
So let's see what the
hell is going on, shall we?

34
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,976
Great.

35
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,179
There's an old Woody Allen quote:

36
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,051
"If you want to make God laugh,

37
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:13,922
tell him about your plans."

38
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,426
And though I have complicated feelings

39
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,832
about Woody Allen, post Soon-Yi,

40
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,502
it's still a very wise quote.

41
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,305
Okay, I made a decision.

42
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:23,807
- _
- Ready?

43
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,577
- Lista.
- We're ready.

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,298
I'm going to go to the
University of Miami.

45
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,667
Wow.

46
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:32,771
I thought you were leaning towards Iowa.

47
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:36,775
- _
- Yeah, well, I weighed everything

48
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,612
and Miami makes the most sense.

49
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,982
I can write on the side while
I'm getting my teaching degree,

50
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,317
plus if I live at home,
then I'll save money,

51
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,589
which will put me a little
ahead on my five-year plan.

52
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,657
- _
- You don't even have a plan.

53
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,492
- _
- Well, that's not true, dad.

54
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,229
I plan to go to Bora Bora next week.

55
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,965
Bora Bora? When are you going

56
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,133
to get your life together?
Look at your sister.

57
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,402
Even she is on the right path.

58
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:58,804
No, thank you.

59
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,808
I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics

60
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,475
either end up in rehab, in jail or dead.

61
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,078
I chose rehab.

62
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,981
There is no need to give them
every single detail, Luisa.

63
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,819
In any case, you need a job.

64
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,654
No, I really don't.

65
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,288
Oh, yeah, I'm definitely
working while I'm in college.

66
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,657
I mean, it may take a little longer,

67
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,527
but I don't want to graduate with debt.

68
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,797
- Then I'm going to cut you off.
- That's ridiculous.

69
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,666
You're lazy. You're unmotivated.

70
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,671
By 30, I see myself tenured at a school,

71
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:24,843
my first novel about to be published...

72
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:26,955
_

73
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,514
Definitely married but no kids yet.

74
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,584
I want my life set up first.

75
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,689
You've done nothing with your life.

76
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,724
You've accomplished nothing.

77
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,160
Can I just say

78
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,598
how proud I am of you, honey?

79
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,071
You are such a disappointment.

80
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:43,172
- Thanks, dad.
- Thanks, mom.

81
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,054
- It means a lot.
- It means a lot.

82
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,175
- _
- Wow.

83
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:49,111
Babies need a lot of gear.

84
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:51,580
No, they don't. It's
all marketing, all right?

85
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,283
They act like you need all this
stuff, when really, you just...

86
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,550
Oh, my God, do you see?

87
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,886
That little snowsuit
with the little ears.

88
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,088
We live in Miami.

89
00:02:58,138 --> 00:02:59,639
I'm not gonna register for it.

90
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:00,674
I was just saying that it was cute.

91
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,116
Hey, tell me about the shower.

92
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,019
Do I get to come in and
make, like, a grand entrance

93
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,791
and play cutesy games or whatever?

94
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,325
I don't do games. You know
what, I don't even know

95
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:09,925
what half of these things are.

96
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:11,561
And the other half, I'm
not registering for them

97
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:13,030
- until I read a review.
- You read reviews?

98
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:14,265
I read multiple reviews.

99
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,101
And I review.

100
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,035
Of course you do.

101
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,238
Okay, come on.

102
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,807
Let's look at something we know we need.

103
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,586
- Cribs.
- Cribs, okay. Cribs are cute.

104
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,910
- Yes. Just definitely not that one.
- Oh, I love that one.

105
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,279
Really?

106
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,015
What's wrong with this one?

107
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:30,818
J... it... the bars...

108
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,586
It's just so prison-like.

109
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,089
But they all have bars.

110
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,324
Well, then, I want the Orange
is the New Black version.

111
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:38,960
A friendly prison,

112
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,661
where one has a chance
to explore their identity.

113
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,128
Although, we could just get 'em both.

114
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,629
One for your place, one for mine.

115
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,164
And just like that,

116
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,432
a terrifying thought

117
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,802
- occurred to them both.
- _

118
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:53,535
Well, maybe not
terrifying, but expensive.

119
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,739
I got it.

120
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,244
Ah, yes, Michael.

121
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:59,743
Hi.

122
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,077
You'll recall that, up until recently,

123
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,578
Michael had plans of his own.

124
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,245
What's going on?

125
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,746
Did you find my father?

126
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,013
No.

127
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,848
But I do need to talk to you.

128
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,583
About... Sin Rostro.

129
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,334
_

130
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:17,586
Should I leave, or...

131
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:19,421
Depends how much you want her to hear.

132
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:21,056
Everything.

133
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:22,290
Anything.

134
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:23,525
Stay.

135
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,558
Sin Rostro is your stepmother, Rose.

136
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,657
- _
- Wow.

137
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,959
Um...

138
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,563
Let's... let's sit down.

139
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,801
So how do you know that it's Rose?

140
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,469
Are you sure?

141
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,772
I don't want to interrupt,

142
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,274
but I do think it's important

143
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,698
that you know what Jane's thinking.

144
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,806
- _
- All the evidence leads to her.

145
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,074
She's been running an underground

146
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:50,075
- plastic surgery ring.
- _

147
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,492
She's been surgically changing
the faces of criminals.

148
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,050
_

149
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,517
We have reason to believe she may have

150
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,606
- altered her own face.
- _

151
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,191
- If Rose altered her own face,
- _

152
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,328
she could look entirely different.

153
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,596
She could be... Anyone.

154
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,167
At least you know my
father's not involved.

155
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,036
I don't know that at all.

156
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:14,171
Sin Rostro had a network of associates,

157
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,907
and your father could
have been one of them.

158
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:19,611
What are you implying?

159
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:20,978
I'm implying exactly what
you know I'm implying.

160
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,612
Rose didn't kill Roman Zazo

161
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,081
and your father is still at large.

162
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,643
So if he contacts you, you let us know.

163
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,823
You, too, Jane.

164
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,160
- Jane?
- Huh?

165
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,263
Sorry.

166
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,031
Can you repeat the question?

167
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,455
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -
- www.addic7ed.com -

168
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,242
I'm gonna need to talk
to your sister, too.

169
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,477
How can I reach her?

170
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,012
She's at Haven View Psychiatric Hospital.

171
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,280
What's she doing there?

172
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:56,222
Um... she had a breakdown.

173
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:58,188
Claimed she was having
an affair with Rose.

174
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,388
You mean Sin Rostro.

175
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,890
Oh, my God, Rafael...

176
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,391
I-I gotta get her out of there.

177
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:04,660
All right, Betty...

178
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:05,928
I'm breaking out of here.

179
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,600
Poor Luisa.

180
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:09,836
Always one crucial step behind.

181
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:11,739
I am. I've had it.

182
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,707
No phone privileges, are you kidding me?

183
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,075
Just because of one little incident?

184
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,476
This is an emergency.

185
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,577
I need you to go to the Marbella hotel.

186
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,446
I think my father might
be a criminal mastermind

187
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,880
and I'm worried that my stepmother

188
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:26,515
is in imminent danger.

189
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,019
Yes, I am calling

190
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,754
from the Haven View Psychiatric Hospital.

191
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:36,356
This is the key to my escape.

192
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,490
Don't tell anyone, Betty.

193
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,526
- _
- I have to get out of here.

194
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,462
As long as Rose is
with my father, she's...

195
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,032
She's in danger.

196
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,202
Look, I know what you're going to say.

197
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:50,770
Why am I trying to help
Rose, after what she did?

198
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,272
Putting me in here...

199
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,742
I should hate her for that.

200
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,112
I do hate her for that.

201
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,215
Yeah, I know.

202
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,649
I don't believe me either.

203
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:01,917
Wait, so his stepmother's

204
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,820
like a real-life criminal mastermind?

205
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,056
- Yes.
- Wow.

206
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,561
That's like straight
out of La Reina del Sur.

207
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,696
- Right?
- Like when Teresa Mendoza turns into

208
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:11,163
this huge drug queen and
she ends up killing Teo...

209
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,831
Exactly, that's exactly
what I was thinking!

210
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,067
But I couldn't tell Rafael that.

211
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,369
So what did you say?

212
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,672
Oh, something about

213
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:17,974
I'm sure his father will turn up.

214
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:20,376
So you think he knows
where his father is?

215
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,478
- What? No...
- It's not out of the question.

216
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,913
You'd hide me if I were a criminal.

217
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,717
- No, I wouldn't.
- I'd hide you if you were a criminal.

218
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,754
That's because I wouldn't
do something that bad.

219
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,122
And you think I would?

220
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,425
Example "A," you have a temper.

221
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:33,693
Oh, hello.

222
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,928
Please, don't let my mood

223
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,861
interrupt your good times.

224
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:38,661
Hey, Rogelio.

225
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:39,828
Dad.

226
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,163
You're locked into "dad" now.

227
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,733
Dad. Got it.

228
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:45,567
I wanted to talk to you both

229
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,236
about my job offer in Mexico.

230
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:51,138
I am being pressured by
my publicist to take it.

231
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,778
So... you're leaving for Mexico?

232
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:59,549
I don't know.

233
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:01,584
I-I also got a job offer...

234
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,655
here.

235
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,023
To play the second lead

236
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,458
in Esteban's Telenovela.

237
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,059
_

238
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,160
Their ratings need a boost.

239
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:13,165
Normally, I would never
consider it, but...

240
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,873
Well, we've just connected.

241
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,973
And I don't want to lose that.

242
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:22,078
We won't.

243
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,781
Look, I selfishly want you to stay.

244
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:27,320
But... if you want to
go for your career...

245
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,491
I get it.

246
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:34,829
Anyway, I'm tired, so
I'm gonna go to bed.

247
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll leave you guys to talk.

248
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:38,869
- Night, hon.
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,031
- Good night.
- Night.

250
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,844
So, what are you going to do?

251
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:50,212
I'm not sure.

252
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:53,583
What do you think I should do?

253
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:55,317
Here's what he hoped she would say:

254
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,155
Stay here. With me.

255
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,587
And... here's what she said:

256
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:03,254
You should do whatever makes you happy.

257
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,461
What would make you happy?

258
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,028
Here's what she hoped he would say:

259
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,627
You, Xiomara.

260
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,863
And... here's what he said:

261
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,366
Neither option is perfect.

262
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,503
Take everything up to
the presidential suite.

263
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,425
I'll be staying there for a while.

264
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,539
Mrs. Solano...

265
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,276
Mrs. Solano, wait.

266
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,213
The thing is...

267
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:36,381
- Mr. Solano, well...
- _

268
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:38,551
He's banned you from the hotel, ma'am.

269
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:40,521
Hmm. Did he?

270
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:42,657
And what is your name?

271
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,892
Gabriel.

272
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,394
Excellent.

273
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,530
Gabriel, can you tell
me exactly what he said?

274
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,098
Great, as long as he got the money,

275
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,365
I want out of this whole mess.

276
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,398
And clearly, use discretion

277
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,531
when wiring the last of it
so nothing can be traced.

278
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,333
So you think he knows
where his father is?

279
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,772
Just let me know if anything changes.

280
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,639
Yeah. So we're all good.

281
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,307
All right. Bye-bye.

282
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,573
Hey.

283
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,307
Hey...

284
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,041
What was that all about?

285
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,542
Uh, Luisa.

286
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:11,910
I have to get her out of the hospital,

287
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,611
but I need the power of attorney.

288
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,813
This was absolutely true.

289
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:18,320
_

290
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,652
- _
- I have to make another call

291
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,153
about it, actually.

292
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,555
Yeah. I have to get to work.

293
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,258
Yeah, uh, we have a meeting, so...

294
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

295
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,735
- I'll see you.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,762
Hello, Jane.

297
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,731
Oh, hi.

298
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,133
I thought you left.

299
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,569
Oh, I did.

300
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,172
But I'm back.

301
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,574
What are you doing here, Petra?

302
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,942
I banned you from this hotel.

303
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,343
Hmm, yes, I know.

304
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,576
The manager, uh...

305
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,977
Gabriel was his name, right?

306
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,177
Yeah, anyway, he told me.

307
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,778
Then I fired him.

308
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,979
Consider it my first act
as co-owner of the Marbella.

309
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,480
What?

310
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:58,049
Oh, didn't you know?

311
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,750
Yes, well...

312
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,153
The company that bought into
the hotel, Stanwyk Investments...

313
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,353
It's a family company.

314
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:07,019
My old boyfriend's family.

315
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:09,558
And, well, he bought it for me.

316
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,159
So we need to talk
about some changes, hmm?

317
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,160
The hotel's reputation has taken a hit.

318
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:17,531
And I believe that the first step

319
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,165
towards changing public perception is

320
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,033
to distance ourselves
from the Solano name.

321
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,471
Meaning, stripping you from
your day-to-day responsibilities.

322
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,239
What are you talking about, Petra?

323
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:29,506
I believe the term is "silent partner."

324
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,508
Shh...

325
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,414
This man, Emilio Solano,

326
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,917
is potentially armed and dangerous.

327
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,686
If anyone sees or hears anything...

328
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,222
So listen, we need to have a
meeting asap about your shower.

329
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:42,824
Okay, don't make a big thing about it.

330
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,386
I'm gonna make a big thing about it.

331
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,363
That's it.

332
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,799
Just keep your eyes open.

333
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,402
Thank you.

334
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,773
I'm sorry about that.

335
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,576
Jane, I meant it before.

336
00:11:58,578 --> 00:11:59,845
Emilio might try to reach out to his son,

337
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,813
and if he does, we need to know.

338
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,347
Great, as long as he got the money,

339
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,485
I want out of this mess.

340
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,421
What is it?

341
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:09,089
- Nothing.
- Jane.

342
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,390
This isn't about Rafael
or you or me, okay?

343
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:12,555
It's about this.

344
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:13,523
Ugh.

345
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,788
Roman Zazo was murdered.

346
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,155
And his killer is still out there.

347
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:20,461
So be careful, okay?

348
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,728
It should be noted that Jane's
first thought was Rafael.

349
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,829
She really needed to talk to him.

350
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:28,031
- _
- But then this happened.

351
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,032
No one knows you're here, okay?

352
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,898
- _
- Get some rest.

353
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,432
Okay, that absolutely did
not mean he was hiding Emilio.

354
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,401
And it's certainly not
like Jane should get

355
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,402
the master key and break in.

356
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:43,871
That would be ridiculous.

357
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:46,843
And dangerous.

358
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,477
She should definitely leave.

359
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,777
Right now.

360
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,480
But there's no harm in knocking, right?

361
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,589
Did you forget something?

362
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,571
Jane.

363
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:12,672
Michael, hi.

364
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,207
A-are you okay? What's wrong?

365
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,409
Nothing.

366
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,510
You always look away

367
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:17,846
when you're not telling the truth.

368
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,615
I just was... I was looking for Rafael.

369
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:21,016
And you look scared.

370
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,951
Is this about his father, about the case?

371
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,553
Jane.

372
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,123
Roman Zazo's murderer is on the loose.

373
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,259
But I just saw him.

374
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,562
Hi, Michael.

375
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,331
Hi, Jane.

376
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,933
Hi.

377
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,303
What the hell is going on?

378
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,509
I'm Aaron Zazo.

379
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,311
- Aaron?
- Yeah.

380
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,411
I'm Roman's twin brother.

381
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:51,549
I'm so sorry I scared you.

382
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,651
I figured you were someone
who knew my brother,

383
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,554
but I didn't know who you were.

384
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,490
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

385
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:00,528
I used to have sisters that are twins.

386
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,964
One of them has a bigger
dimple, I think, maybe.

387
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,600
Look, start at the beginning.

388
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,301
What is going on?

389
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,102
After Zaz died, I knew I
had to find his brother.

390
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:10,736
But they hadn't spoken in years,

391
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:12,334
and I didn't know where to start.

392
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,502
So I hired a private investigator,

393
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,636
and eventually I tracked
Aaron down to an orphanage

394
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,468
in Mexico where he volunteered.

395
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,534
But he had just been
kidnapped by a cartel.

396
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,871
It happens down there.

397
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,706
- They grab you, demand cash.
- I negotiated

398
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,241
- with the cartel.
- I owe this man my life.

399
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:28,374
He's one of the good guys, Jane.

400
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,872
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

401
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,874
Because the kidnappers demanded secrecy.

402
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:34,709
They said they were gonna kill him.

403
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,410
I need to talk to you about your brother.

404
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,544
Absolutely. Satya.

405
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,946
It means, "all in pursuit of truth."

406
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,380
It's a part of my religion.

407
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm a Jain.

408
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:50,381
_

409
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,978
I just want to know what
happened to my brother.

410
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:57,514
I'm sorry.

411
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:58,848
L-look, I...

412
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,216
I was looking for you.

413
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,417
But I ran into Michael instead.

414
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:02,851
I tried not to say anything,

415
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:04,786
- but he just, he knows me so well.
- God.

416
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,991
And I was scared.

417
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,993
I thought that I just saw a dead man.

418
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,628
And what were you doing even knocking

419
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,029
on the door in the first place, huh?

420
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,449
I saw you come out,

421
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,551
and you put a "do not disturb" sign on,

422
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,218
and you had that weird call earlier,

423
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,187
and I just...

424
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,023
I thought that maybe
your father was in there.

425
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,225
- What?
- But I didn't really think that.

426
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:27,693
I just...

427
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,227
I couldn't rule it out a hundred percent.

428
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,295
Because you don't trust me.

429
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,562
No, I do.

430
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,996
Really?

431
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,630
'Cause it doesn't feel like it.

432
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,466
Can we just talk about this later?

433
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:43,100
I have to get my sister out
of the mental institution.

434
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,074
All right, this is
how I'm gonna bust out.

435
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:48,508
You know Dan, the hot delivery guy?

436
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,410
Yeah, I know, I don't see

437
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:51,880
why everyone thinks he's so hot.

438
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,516
- He's so basic.
- Anyway,

439
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:54,717
every other Friday,

440
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,583
Dan delivers supplies to our floor.

441
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:57,850
And Nurse Chelsea...

442
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,186
- _
- I know, she's so tragic,

443
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:01,355
she just reeks of desperation.

444
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,591
Anyway, she's always flirting with Dan.

445
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:06,095
So all I have to do is sneak by them

446
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,831
while Chelsea's distracted.

447
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,101
And then I can use Rose's brooch

448
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,170
to pick the lock by the back door

449
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,971
and voilà... I'm free.

450
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:33,888
Luisa?

451
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,024
Hey,

452
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,125
you.

453
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,827
What are you doing here?

454
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,832
I finally got power of attorney.

455
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,867
I'm here to sign you out.

456
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,838
Great.

457
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,908
Let's go back in this way.

458
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,712
It's a shortcut.

459
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,829
Ah...

460
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:02,764
We're all responsible
for our own baggage.

461
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,598
At least that's what I
learned in the mental hospital.

462
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,501
- Luisa?
- What?

463
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,266
Look, I don't know what
made you change your mind

464
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:14,934
and decide to sign me out,

465
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:17,169
- but I cannot believe that...
- Rose is Sin Rostro.

466
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,702
Come again?

467
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,264
Rose, our stepmother...

468
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:23,605
Is Sin Rostro.

469
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,571
Sin Rostro,

470
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,475
like, that crazy big drug-dealer person?

471
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:30,876
Yeah, except she got out of drugs

472
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:33,047
and now runs a plastic surgery ring

473
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,609
that apparently changes criminals' faces.

474
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,021
You don't say.

475
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,126
Wow.

476
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,593
Sin Rostro, like, killed people, right?

477
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,662
Only those who really deserved it.

478
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:49,100
Lu, I am so sorry.

479
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,503
And I believe you now.

480
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,538
That's good, that's great.

481
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,874
Okay.

482
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,509
I ran everything by your grandmother,

483
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,444
and we both agreed that this
will be a dry baby shower.

484
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,983
Apparently, we feel
very strongly about this.

485
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,853
It's really sweet what
you're doing for me, Lina.

486
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:07,454
Are you kidding?

487
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,088
Your best friend throws
you your baby shower,

488
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,623
- that's the rule.
- I know,

489
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,992
but, you know, it's been
kind of weird with us.

490
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:14,261
Since the whole Frankie thing.

491
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:15,228
Yeah, I know.

492
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,930
And I missed you.

493
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:17,897
So...

494
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,198
I missed you, too.

495
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,198
Okay, we'll hug it out later,

496
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,201
but we have things to accomplish here.

497
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,771
Okay, did you finish
your target registry?

498
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,709
- No.
- Jane.

499
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,009
It's complicated.

500
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,641
I mean, where are we gonna even live?

501
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,709
Do we get two of everything
or one of everything?

502
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,345
Hmm, I didn't think about that.

503
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,045
Okay, we'll just say "cash."

504
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,913
next up... Party game.

505
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,914
- Oh, God, I hate party games.
- I know you don't like party games.

506
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,087
You'll just fill this
out about each other.

507
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,354
Where did you meet?

508
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:48,922
That'll be funny.

509
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,812
Um, what's your favorite song?

510
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,647
Oh, and, um, this is a good one...

511
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,849
Which one of you will
be the disciplinarian?

512
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,278
Luisa, there is so much I
want to say to you but can't.

513
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,015
So let me say this.

514
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:23,096
I'm sorry that you were
hurt during all of this.

515
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:25,634
And I know you have so many questions,

516
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,470
so I want to answer one.

517
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,372
Unfortunately, your father is

518
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:31,873
where the lightning first struck,

519
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,810
where there were fireworks.

520
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:35,779
Sounds like gibberish to me,

521
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,861
but clearly it meant something to Luisa.

522
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,423
Look, you were right.

523
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,959
I shouldn't have knocked on that door,

524
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,996
and I should have
trusted you enough to wait

525
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,365
and ask you what was going on.

526
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,836
But, I mean, can you blame me, really?

527
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,571
I mean, with everything
that's going on...

528
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:54,173
I mean, the murders and twins
and mastermind criminals,

529
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,682
this is not normal stuff.
It's pretty friggin' crazy.

530
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:00,053
Yeah, you're right.

531
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:03,755
But even with all that, I
thought that you trusted me.

532
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,492
And I do.

533
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:08,596
For the most part.

534
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,397
Ah, yeah, see, "for the most part"...

535
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:12,831
Doesn't feel great.

536
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,899
Yeah, but how can it be
anything more than that?

537
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:17,001
I mea... I mean, I don't even
know what your favorite song is.

538
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:18,003
What?

539
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,770
Nothing, oh, it's just

540
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,071
this silly question
on a baby shower game.

541
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,740
The-the point is, is that

542
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,809
I didn't know any of the answers.

543
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,610
And that's because we just
met. And I know it doesn't

544
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,745
feel that way because of everything

545
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:32,850
we've been dealing
with, but it's the truth.

546
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,955
We did just meet. And trust takes time.

547
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,124
And you could have told me about Aaron,

548
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:40,624
but you didn't. No, and I know now...

549
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,360
That that was a matter of his safety,

550
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:44,360
but I wasn't gonna say anything.

551
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:46,494
That's fair.

552
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,462
We'll get there.

553
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,666
Yeah, we will.

554
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,210
"Livin' on a Prayer"

555
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:00,248
that's your favorite song?

556
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,216
Really?

557
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,417
Bon Jovi?

558
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,552
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no, no.

559
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,690
Hold on.

560
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,893
Hello.

561
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,731
Luisa?

562
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,668
Are you okay?

563
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,504
Hmm, not great.

564
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:22,076
Luisa, what are you doing out here?

565
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:23,745
Rose...

566
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:27,282
Sin Rostro, I found this letter from her.

567
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,584
Read the last sentence.

568
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:31,016
I don't know when she left it.

569
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,550
It might've been when she came to visit.

570
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:35,487
"Your father is where the
lightning first struck.

571
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:36,857
There were fireworks."

572
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,193
What does that mean?

573
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:41,393
We made love for the
first time in a pool.

574
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,629
Rafael,

575
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,232
I'm pretty sure right now I'm...

576
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,234
I'm sitting on dad.

577
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,314
You know that feeling when
you've been up all night

578
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:56,217
waiting to find out if
your boyfriend's father

579
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:58,322
was dug out of a reflecting pool?

580
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:00,090
Sure you don't want to eat anything?

581
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:01,657
No, no, no, I'm fine.

582
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,193
Well, that's how Jane's feeling.

583
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,931
Hello.

584
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,130
This is he.

585
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,633
Okay, thank you.

586
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,604
So, they found him.

587
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:25,943
I'm so sorry.

588
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,244
Yeah, I, um, I need to
make funeral arrangements

589
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,879
and, uh, call a board meeting.

590
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,948
'Cause Petra's gonna try
to use this to take control.

591
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,417
- So...
- You can do that later.

592
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,187
No, I really can't.

593
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,522
I know her; She's gonna pounce.

594
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,691
I got to be prepared.

595
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,961
Speaking of prepared,

596
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,997
Luisa was ready to share everything.

597
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,770
Okay, I'm gonna need
you to tell me everything

598
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:50,639
that happened between you and Rose.

599
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:52,041
No detail is too small.

600
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:56,143
Finally, a chance to tell the truth

601
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:58,714
about the greatest love story ever told.

602
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,454
It all started about five years ago.

603
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,093
I was sitting alone at a girl bar,

604
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:08,530
and then I saw her.

605
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:11,896
She was wearing this tight red dress

606
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:15,334
that highlighted every curve of her body,

607
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:18,402
her breasts, her hips, her...

608
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:20,206
Got it. Good.

609
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,906
And then she sat down next to me.

610
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,710
Hi.

611
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,681
We could both feel it,

612
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,482
that instant attraction.

613
00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:31,883
Can I buy you a drink?

614
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,984
34 days sober.

615
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,921
Gotcha.

616
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:39,526
I am just getting out
of the drug world myself.

617
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:41,496
Of course, when she was
talking about the drug world,

618
00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:42,765
she was referring to her former

619
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,533
half-billion-dollar-a-year business.

620
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,667
Yeah.

621
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:48,270
I didn't pick up on that.

622
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:51,543
I mentioned the red dress, right?

623
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:52,545
Yes.

624
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,481
And what happened then?

625
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,083
And then we left.

626
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:59,052
We just wanted time to be alone.

627
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,921
So how long are you in town?

628
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,590
The weekend.

629
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:07,363
I'm trying to close this
deal, but my heart's not in it.

630
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:09,132
She was trying to
close a deal, all right.

631
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:10,800
She was dating a man

632
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:12,169
so she could use his hotel

633
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,373
for her illegal plastic surgery ring,

634
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,577
and her heart wasn't in it because,

635
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,545
well, Rose was a lesbian.

636
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:21,081
I really did not expect this.

637
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,587
I guess you never know when
lightning is gonna strike.

638
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:29,425
And then she kissed me.

639
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:32,933
And then there were fireworks.

640
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,369
It was also the fourth of July.

641
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,836
And then we made love.

642
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,573
Raw, passionate, desperate love.

643
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,909
Okay, then what?

644
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:44,874
We made love again.

645
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,742
- Okay, after that?
- And yet again.

646
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:47,777
Okay, well,

647
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,980
let's assume you guys

648
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,615
had sex a bunch of times.

649
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:52,883
Can we skip ahead?

650
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:55,087
I thought I'd never see her again.

651
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:57,624
And then I went to a
family dinner that night.

652
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,292
It was a horrible night.

653
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,495
My dad was all over my brother.

654
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:03,933
You are such a disappointment.

655
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,002
Thanks, dad.

656
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,204
It means a lot.

657
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,705
Oh, my God.

658
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,140
Oh, good, you made it.

659
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,942
I am so sorry I'm late.

660
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,344
Traffic was terrible.

661
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,012
Ah, yes,

662
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,781
the deal Rose was trying to close,

663
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,216
it was Emilio.

664
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:19,617
You're dating my father?

665
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,217
Please lower your voice.

666
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:24,985
What about last night?

667
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:27,853
It was a mistake.

668
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:30,024
I really, I do have feelings for him.

669
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:31,294
I...

670
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,896
It's getting serious.

671
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,597
Look, I just, I...

672
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,636
I think I needed to be with a woman

673
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,139
one last time, you know?

674
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:41,809
Just...

675
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:43,477
Get it out of my system.

676
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,445
Yeah, I get it.

677
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,680
I mean, I have a girlfriend anyway.

678
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:51,119
Her name's Allison,

679
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,055
and she loves to have sex in bathrooms.

680
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:56,023
Good.

681
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,223
I'm glad.

682
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:06,200
You have some...

683
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:08,902
Mashed potatoes on your shirt.

684
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,572
Can I get a glass of water, please?

685
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:13,074
Is that allowed?

686
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:14,909
Again, you're not under arrest.

687
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,709
You can have anything you want.

688
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,044
So if you can bring

689
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:19,482
my black dress in the morning?

690
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:21,351
Sure, no problem.

691
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:23,755
Thanks. I just don't want
to leave him alone tonight.

692
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,225
Yeah, I get it.

693
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,430
How's he holding up?

694
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,436
He seems...

695
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:34,039
Okay right now.

696
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,840
You know, he's just making arrangements

697
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:38,041
for the funeral and talking
to his lawyer about business.

698
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,212
Well, people cope in different ways.

699
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:42,147
Yeah, I know. I...

700
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:45,381
I just don't know what he needs

701
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:47,418
or how to help him.

702
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,620
Well, just be there for him, I think.

703
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:50,787
That's all you can do.

704
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,355
I just...

705
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,258
I did something really stupid today,

706
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,860
and I-I'm just worried

707
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,429
that he's not gonna trust me enough

708
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:59,630
to open up, you know?

709
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:02,000
For some of us, it's hard,

710
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:04,269
talking about feelings and stuff.

711
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:28,668
Hello?

712
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,104
Luisa?

713
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:33,274
It's me.

714
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,575
How are you?

715
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:36,077
How am I?

716
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,080
You put me in a mental institution.

717
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:39,681
You killed my father!

718
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,850
I know, and I'm sorry.

719
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:44,420
Why are we only seeing her back?

720
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:46,423
But this plan, it's been
in the works for years.

721
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:49,123
Oh, maybe she's changed her face.

722
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,490
Before we met.

723
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:53,258
Why are you calling me?

724
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,997
Because how I feel
about you, what we have,

725
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,700
that was the only thing in my life

726
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:59,600
this past five years that was real.

727
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:03,334
And you once said that you
wanted to run away with me.

728
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,735
Do you still?

729
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,306
You okay?

730
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,008
Yeah.

731
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,212
Petra called a board
meeting an hour from now.

732
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:24,850
It's a power play.

733
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:26,453
She's got no shame.

734
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,390
I'm so sorry.

735
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:32,157
It really was a beautiful service.

736
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,967
I, um, I need to go talk to my sister.

737
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,203
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

738
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,244
- _ 
- Mm-hmm.

739
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,685
You okay?

740
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:02,557
Yeah, I just...

741
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,060
I can't believe he's gone.

742
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:06,230
I know.

743
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:11,838
I'm so sorry, Lu.

744
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,308
For not believing you.

745
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,743
For everything.

746
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:17,913
Thank you.

747
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:20,615
I appreciate that.

748
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:25,694
And listen, I know this is
the worst time in the world,

749
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,028
and trust me, I don't want
to be thinking about this.

750
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,997
- What?
- Business.

751
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,433
I don't want anything to do with it.

752
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,235
I know, I know,

753
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,836
but now that dad is gone,

754
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,804
we each own a third of the Marbella.

755
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,571
And Petra, she owns the other third.

756
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:44,475
So, if you assign your shares to me,

757
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:46,643
I can overpower her.

758
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,279
Is that why you apologized to me?

759
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:49,914
Because you want my shares?

760
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,448
No, I was just...

761
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,415
Petra's calling a board
meeting in an hour.

762
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,218
I have to think practically, that's it.

763
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,852
No, you have to think about
the fact that you and dad

764
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:02,555
locked me up in a mental institution.

765
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:03,823
I know.

766
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,926
And when you were sick with cancer,

767
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:08,062
I was there for you.

768
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:10,464
Look, things got messed up.

769
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:12,265
Yeah, they did.

770
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,932
Want to know why?

771
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:16,700
Because of money.

772
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,269
I meant what I said when
I got back from the ashram.

773
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:21,941
Money is the root of all of our problems,

774
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,911
and I want out.

775
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,980
So, yeah.

776
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:27,549
You can have my shares.

777
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,891
And if you don't mind,
I-I want to be alone now.

778
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,097
Thanks for coming today.

779
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:37,968
It really meant a lot.

780
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,803
Of course.

781
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,474
In such sad days, it helps people

782
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:44,376
to see a celebrity.

783
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,877
And like you said,

784
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,881
we are a part of each other's lives now.

785
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:50,183
No matter what happens.

786
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,717
So does that mean you made
a decision about Mexico?

787
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,251
No.

788
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,487
Not yet,

789
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:57,190
but your mother thinks I should go.

790
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,426
- Come on.
- That's what she said.

791
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:01,428
That I should do what makes me happy.

792
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,169
Would it have made a difference
if she said something else?

793
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,338
Perhaps.

794
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:11,377
Okay, you two,

795
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:13,713
we were just at a funeral,
and if that doesn't say

796
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,479
that life is too short,
I don't know what does.

797
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:16,882
So you two are gonna tell each other

798
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:19,185
how you feel honestly right now.

799
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,586
Go.

800
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,522
Okay, mom, you go first.

801
00:31:23,524 --> 00:31:24,723
Rogelio is...

802
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,559
Dad?

803
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,361
Right.

804
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:31,664
Dad is considering going to Mexico.

805
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,735
How does that make you feel?

806
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,771
You know.

807
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:37,036
No, we don't.

808
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:38,370
Tell us.

809
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:40,406
I guess...

810
00:31:40,408 --> 00:31:43,112
I'd be... bummed.

811
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:44,246
"Bummed."

812
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:46,446
Okay, good.

813
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,047
We can work with "bummed."

814
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,882
Why?

815
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:51,383
His turn.

816
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:52,952
Okay.

817
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,822
Mom said she would feel bummed.

818
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:57,789
How would you feel if you
were far away from her?

819
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:02,591
I would feel like... Santos felt

820
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:05,395
when he was separated from Blanca.

821
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:07,730
Okay, now real world version.

822
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,666
- I'd be devastated.
- Why?

823
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:11,534
Because I have very strong
feelings for your mother.

824
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:13,672
And I would like to see where things go.

825
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:15,739
Really?

826
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:17,072
Of course. Go on, mom.

827
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,240
Tell him how you feel.

828
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:19,474
I have really strong feelings

829
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:20,775
for you, too, and I
don't want you to leave.

830
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,409
Then I won't go. I will stay

831
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:23,743
and work on Esteban's show.

832
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:25,777
But you hate him.

833
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,477
And what if you hate it?
A-and if you do it for me

834
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,877
and-and you don't like it, I don't know,

835
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,011
you might blame me.

836
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,512
Never. And I will shine

837
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,744
on Esteban's show the way I always shine!

838
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,576
Even brighter because
you will be by my side.

839
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:43,778
There has been an awakening.

840
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,085
Have you felt it?

841
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,761
Bueno.

842
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,511
_

843
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,737
Seriously, was it that difficult

844
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:06,299
for them to tell each
other how they feel?

845
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,071
_

846
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:13,795
_

847
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:18,319
_

848
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:21,553
Yeah.

849
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:24,018
I don't think Rafael feels safe with me.

850
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,054
We got into a fight earlier
and I didn't trust him.

851
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,822
Which... hurt.

852
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:31,923
And I get that.

853
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,559
Bueno...

854
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,583
_

855
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,607
_

856
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,439
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

857
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,440
Exactly.

858
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,478
So, how do I fix it?

859
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Thank you all so much for meeting.

860
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:51,251
Look, I know it's short
notice, but I thought

861
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,220
it would be a good time
to talk about our game plan

862
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,922
- moving forward.
- That's great.

863
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:58,462
Luisa's here to formally
assign her shares over to me.

864
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,027
Which means I am still in charge.

865
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:01,563
Actually, Rafael,

866
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,901
I've changed my mind about the shares.

867
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,402
Uh...

868
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:09,170
I thought you didn't want to have

869
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,873
anything to do with this hotel.

870
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,079
I don't. I'm assigning
my shares to Petra.

871
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,281
What? Are you crazy?!

872
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:18,315
No, actually, I'm not crazy.

873
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,116
Okay, I should probably explain.

874
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:22,218
Remember when this happened?

875
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,787
I meant what I said when
I got back from the ashram.

876
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,822
Money is the root of all of our problems.

877
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:29,091
And I want out.

878
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:31,193
So, yeah.

879
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,362
You can have my shares.

880
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,286
Luisa?

881
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,122
I... I saw you here.

882
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:56,925
And I-I...

883
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:59,763
Well, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

884
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,996
Your father was always good to me.

885
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:03,297
Thank you.

886
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,565
I appreciate that.

887
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,168
I want to apologize to you.

888
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,803
We never got along.

889
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,341
And that's my fault.

890
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,442
But a day like today...

891
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:18,110
It makes you reflect.

892
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,346
That's what my shaman says, anyway.

893
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:22,047
You have a shaman?

894
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:25,119
Yes. Uh...

895
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:28,090
I went to an ashram a few weeks ago.

896
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,226
I know, I know, I know it sounds silly.

897
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,194
No. It doesn't.

898
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,397
Really?

899
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,201
I wish Rafael would consider an ashram.

900
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:40,037
He's so...

901
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,205
Misguided, you know?

902
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,475
Money is destroying your life.

903
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,443
You're not relating to
people as people anymore.

904
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,611
We're all just financial
liabilities to you.

905
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:51,979
Luisa, look.

906
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,680
I get that you are mad, okay?

907
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:56,853
But, please, do not
give Petra your shares.

908
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,522
I'm not giving them to her.

909
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,194
I'm assigning her my voting rights

910
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:03,594
while I go to my ashram to think.

911
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,996
That is crazy.

912
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,632
There you go with that word again.

913
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,031
Uh... Look...

914
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,398
Uh, I'm gonna go.

915
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,499
I'm gonna take off.

916
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:16,100
Take care of yourself.

917
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,670
Well, I guess that's settled.

918
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,039
So, let's talk about some changes.

919
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,840
Shall we?

920
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:24,509
From now on...

921
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,811
I'm the face of the Marbella.

922
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:33,545
To say that Petra was on
top of the world right now,

923
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,613
well, that would be a
gross understatement.

924
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:36,937
Hi. How are you?

925
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:38,137
Petra had just made the world

926
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:40,642
her bitch.

927
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:42,709
Uh, what floor?

928
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:44,678
And then

929
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,079
she saw her dead ex-lover.

930
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,515
Roman?

931
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,050
No.

932
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:52,052
I-I'm his brother Aaron.

933
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:54,724
Yes. Oh.

934
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:56,127
Yes, of course you are.

935
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,619
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

936
00:36:57,621 --> 00:37:01,192
You just... you look so much like him.

937
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:02,327
What is your name?

938
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,928
Oh, uh, Petra.

939
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,362
Petra.

940
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:07,764
Solano?

941
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:10,191
It is so nice to finally meet you.

942
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,927
My brother's told me so much about you.

943
00:37:14,197 --> 00:37:16,896
I look forward to getting to know you.

944
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,777
I talked to my agent.

945
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,581
I told her that I'm staying here,

946
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,023
working on Esteban's show.

947
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,840
What did she say?

948
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:29,308
That I'm stupid.

949
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,610
But, hey, you pay agents

950
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:31,644
to give their opinion,

951
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:32,844
then you threaten to fire them,

952
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,010
then you hang up on them,

953
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,645
and then you do whatever you want.

954
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,913
You are what I want.

955
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,587
Well, you know what I want?

956
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,731
But what about your vow of chastity?

957
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,835
You said you wanted to wait to have sex.

958
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,874
Yeah, but that was until
there was a commitment.

959
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:55,512
And you just decided
to stay in town for me.

960
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:58,115
That's a pretty good commitment
from where I'm standing.

961
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:00,649
- It is not the same as marriage.
- Why are you arguing, man?

962
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:03,553
Why am I arguing?

963
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:14,251
Michael.

964
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,819
You've got to see this.

965
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:26,525
Where's Luisa?

966
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:27,659
How am I supposed to know?

967
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:29,563
She took off after the meeting.

968
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:30,566
Why?

969
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:33,270
Okay.

970
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:35,440
After Rose sent Luisa a letter,

971
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:38,513
we started monitoring your sister's phone

972
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,583
just in case she tried
to reach out to her.

973
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,653
Well, last night, she did.

974
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,757
Rose asked Luisa to run away with her.

975
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:46,260
Your sister said no.

976
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:48,097
About an hour ago, she sent

977
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:49,265
a text to an encoded number.

978
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:52,736
Yes?

979
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:56,037
Yup. She's gone.

980
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,623
I got takeout Chinese.

981
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,924
I don't know what you like
to eat when you're upset.

982
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:21,364
But egg rolls are my go-to.

983
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:25,001
Egg rolls sound great.

984
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:27,604
Good.

985
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,342
And, look, you don't have to tell me

986
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,844
the way you're feeling right now.

987
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:36,516
I-I just want you to know that you can.

988
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,651
That you can trust me with whatever

989
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:43,390
you're feeling or thinking.

990
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:47,428
Because I love you.

991
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:51,398
I do.

992
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,371
I love you.

993
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,948
I love you. I love you.

994
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,885
And in that moment, it felt
like a telenovela again.

995
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:07,978
But for all the best reasons.

996
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:15,585
And I am so, so sorry

997
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,353
that your father is gone.

998
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:20,626
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

999
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,797
It's, uh...

1000
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,101
Just hard.

1001
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:30,205
'Cause I was a huge disappointment.

1002
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:31,273
No...

1003
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:34,278
No, I was 'cause he told me.

1004
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:38,486
And I'm fighting so hard to change that.

1005
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:57,300
Mm.

1006
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,437
Good morning.

1007
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:04,440
Good morning.

1008
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:07,210
Have you been up long?

1009
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,379
Mm, little bit.

1010
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:12,247
Oh, I filled this out.

1011
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,651
It's our baby shower questionnaire.

1012
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,288
So we can ace that test.

1013
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,424
Aw, that's sweet.

1014
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,657
"Livin' on a Prayer"?

1015
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,390
Really? You don't want
to rethink that one?

1016
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:25,491
That's a great song.

1017
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:27,860
But I do want to rethink something else.

1018
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,394
Caddyshack?

1019
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:35,534
Filling this out

1020
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:39,404
made me think about our
whole registry thing.

1021
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:43,138
Jane, what are we doing, huh?

1022
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,639
I love you.

1023
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,141
You love me.

1024
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:48,776
We're having a baby.

1025
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:51,144
This is true.

1026
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,081
So let's move in together.

1027
