00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,411
Hello...

3
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,956
Tackleberry.

4
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,379
We're all gonna miss you around here.

5
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,549
The Police Academy's getting itself
a real fine recruit.

6
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,095
May I...

7
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,013
go now?

8
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,808
Affirmative, sir.

9
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,061
Ten-four.

10
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,439
Yes, of course. Ten-four.

11
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,894
You guys.

12
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,813
Surprise.

13
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,194
Lot's full, mister.

14
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,573
Look, don't give me that crap.

15
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,660
- You've got a space.
- The lot's full, sir, really.

16
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,079
Find a spot, dickhead.

17
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,249
- Dickhead?
- That's right. Where's the manager?

18
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,583
Dickhead?

19
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,835
Park the car, butt breath.

20
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,171
- Butt breath?
- Yeah.

21
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,342
Wait a minute. Hold everything.
That's a wig, isn't it?

22
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,719
- Ahem. Park the car.
- Yeah, that's a wig.

23
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,305
Wig! Wig! Dong-dong-dong!

24
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,267
- Wig alert! Wig alert! Dong-dong-dong!
- Park the car, asshole. Shut up.

25
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,227
Girls. It's a rug.

26
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,980
What the hell's going on here? Hi, Lou.

27
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,650
- Lou?
- This rude little punk won't park my car.

28
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,527
Mahoney, park this car.

29
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,028
If you can find a spot...

30
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,365
Do it now or you're fired.
You understand? Fired.

31
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,827
Fired? That's not fair,
the guy has a bad attitude.

32
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,412
Do it, okay?

33
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,457
I want you to apologize to this man,
then park his car.

34
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,211
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,549
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

36
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,634
And clean the ashtray while you're at it.

37
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,102
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lou. You just can't get
good help these days.

38
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,565
- Respect for anything.
- They don't respect customers.

39
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,609
They don't respect property.
They don't respect respect.

40
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,488
Holy shit. Jesus.

41
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,081
It fits. Damn thing fits.

42
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,668
I thought there were no more spaces.
Am I an idiot or what?

43
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,384
Hi, fellas.

44
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,644
Hey, guys, just...

45
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,189
Hey, hey!

46
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,665
Guys, I don't think I'm supposed
to get the photos wet.

47
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,428
You're going to pay for this.
Mark my words.

48
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,723
And you want to know why?

49
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,648
I'll let you know why. It's no secret.
Everybody knows.

50
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,150
I'm joining the police force. Ha, ha!

51
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,486
What do you think of that?

52
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,113
Now who's in charge?

53
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,831
Hey, sarge, it's him again.

54
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,458
I'll call Captain Reed.
Sit over there, Mahoney.

55
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,293
All right, let's go.

56
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,467
Sit. And stay there.

57
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,481
- What are you in for?
- I'll show you.

58
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,530
Goddamn it! Stop that!

59
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,157
Oh, no, sir. No, not you.

60
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,075
That's terrific. Really.

61
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,371
- What's your name?
- Jones. Larvell Jones.

62
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,957
Monsignor Larvell Jones.

63
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,208
M.D.

64
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,502
- Let's go, Mahoney.
- See you around, monsignor.

65
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,046
Doctor monsignor.

66
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,393
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

67
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,187
I mean...

68
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,566
What's wrong with you?
Last week: Disturbing the peace.

69
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,403
Week before that:
Destroying private property.

70
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,240
And I'm getting tired of saving your butt.

71
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,203
I only do it because of your father.

72
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,540
- He was a good friend.
- Yeah, I know.

73
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,251
Now, Mahoney, I've made a decision.

74
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,795
I ain't gonna help you this time.

75
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,840
You're going to the county lockup.

76
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,884
- Lockup?
- Mm-hm.

77
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:35,013
Why? I didn't do anything really major.

78
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,974
- Then I'll make a deal with you.
- Anything.

79
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,977
I want you to go to the Police Academy.

80
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,938
The Police Academy?

81
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,149
Even if you never graduate,
the training will be good for you.

82
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,859
Wait a minute.

83
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,986
Wait a minute. Reed?

84
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,698
Listen, you've seen the commercials
on TV.

85
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,661
The Academy's taking
all kinds these days.

86
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,455
Anybody can get in.

87
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,874
Even you.

88
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,377
No deal. That's nuts.

89
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,296
Well, it's either that or the lockup.

90
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,133
- Police Academy or jail.
- Will I get my own squad car?

91
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,971
You'll get 14 weeks of Academy training
and discipline...

92
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,224
- Starting Monday morning.
- Fourteen weeks.

93
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,601
Oh, they can throw you out.

94
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,688
But you can't quit.
You quit, and you're back in jail.

95
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,940
That's the deal.

96
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,442
- Can I bring a friend?
- Who?

97
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,736
Monsignor Larvell Jones,
my personal physician.

98
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,739
You decide.

99
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,077
Honey, please don't go. I love you.
I don't want to see you hurt.

100
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,496
I worry about you.
You're so accident-prone.

101
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,124
And the Police Academy
is such a dangerous place.

102
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,711
Honey, don't worry. I'll be okay.

103
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,254
Everything'll be okay.

104
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,798
You start that car
and you're a dead man, buster.

105
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,341
Honey, I'm late.

106
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,846
You pull out of that driveway
and I'll have your head on a pole.

107
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,934
Come back here, you turkey!

108
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,344
You move this car an inch
and you're finished, mister. You hear me?

109
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,397
Of all the things that you could be
in this world, why a policeman?

110
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,734
A policewoman, mother.

111
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,153
But why?

112
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,489
Because it's exciting, it's different.

113
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,241
It'll give me a chance to meet
interesting and unusual people.

114
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,410
Right now! If you don't pull over...

115
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,163
People who aren't like you and me.

116
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,626
- Hey, look, it's the chief.
- Really?

117
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,461
Hey, mention my name.

118
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,593
Cadet Kyle Blankes
reporting for duty, sir.

119
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,887
Get away from me, you asshole.

120
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,389
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,119
- Where are we, man?
- Ecuador.

122
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,461
Okay! Oh, here we are.
I got to go now. Bye.

123
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,797
- Bye, sweet-pea. Bye, cutie-pie.
- We'll miss you.

124
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,341
- Okay.
- Bye!

125
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,053
Okay, girls. Remember, I love yous.

126
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,015
- Bye!
- Introduce yourself around, man.

127
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,480
Bye! Bye, babies. Goodbye.

128
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,899
Hey, excuse me.

129
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,692
- Do you know all those women?
- Sure.

130
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,611
- They're my girlfriends.
- All of them?

131
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,571
- Yeah.
- Carey Mahoney.

132
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,239
I'm George Martin, Carey.

133
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,575
We should be pals.
You're an interesting guy.

134
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,202
You a cadet?

135
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,496
I am until I can get myself
thrown out of here.

136
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,705
I'll be gone by 10:00.

137
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,374
You, like, joined the Academy
to get thrown out?

138
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,584
That's right.

139
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,504
Hey, you're a pretty interesting guy
yourself.

140
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,681
Look at that.

141
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,643
Just look at that.

142
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,855
Look at that scum.
When I went through this academy...

143
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,900
every cadet was the right weight,
the right height, color...

144
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,611
and they all had Johnsons, Lassard.

145
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,947
Every single one of them.

146
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,156
Johnsons?

147
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,575
You know...

148
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,495
Oh, yes.

149
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,542
Back in the old days, there were Johnsons
as far as the eye could see.

150
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,586
And what a lovely sight it was.

151
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,923
Have you seen these applications?

152
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,303
Have you seen what our new lady mayor
has brought us?

153
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,597
Do you know she is attempting
to dismantle...

154
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,184
one of this country's great institutions
of law and order?

155
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,770
What do you say to that, Lassard?

156
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,939
The bitch.

157
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,150
- Commandant?
- Yes, chief.

158
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,946
The mayor says we've got
to take this flotsam.

159
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,783
But that doesn't mean
we have to put them on the force.

160
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,743
You get my drift?

161
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,455
Weed the undesirables out.

162
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,125
- Get rid of them.
- No problem, chief.

163
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,210
We'll start washing them out
this morning.

164
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,087
We don't throw them out.

165
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,591
They must be encouraged to quit
on their own.

166
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,761
- Do you understand?
- I think I understand, sir.

167
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,432
Thank you, Lieutenant Harris,
I'm sure you do.

168
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,226
- Lassard?
- What?

169
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,562
Do you understand?

170
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,732
- It's clear as glass, chief.
- Good.

171
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,610
Then we all know what to do.

172
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,554
That's it...

173
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,642
There sure are a lot
of spades around here.

174
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,276
Which I think is good.

175
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,612
Very good for the Academy.

176
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,490
What the hell are you doing here?

177
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,743
I want to be a police officer.

178
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,872
What? I can't hear you.

179
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,377
I want to be a police officer.

180
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,173
- Don't unpack.
- Well...

181
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,217
time to get thrown out.

182
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,137
Princess. Princess! Prin...!

183
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,058
- What's your name, Cadet?
- Thompson, sir.

184
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,851
- You live around here?
- No, sir.

185
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,937
What's your telephone number,
Thompson?

186
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,398
Come on, eyes front. Telephone number.

187
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,900
5-5-52-4-6-7, sir.

188
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay, let's see the thighs.

189
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,241
Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.
The thighs.

190
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,996
- What in the hell are you doing?
- Meeting women, sir.

191
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,623
What's your name, dirtbag?

192
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,875
- Dirtbag?
- Your name?

193
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,711
Mahoney, sir.

194
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,129
Back in line, Mahoney.

195
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,549
Sir, can I have a second with you?
Listen.

196
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,801
I don't really belong here.
I'm not right for this.

197
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,556
Get back in line.

198
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,434
Now!

199
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,105
Mom, it's all right. Don't worry.
Come here, Princess.

200
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,973
My name is Commandant Lassard.
Welcome to the new police force.

201
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,268
Your training time here will last...

202
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,979
Fourteen.

203
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,106
Fourteen weeks.

204
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:51,569
You will be schooled in firearms,
police procedures, local laws...

205
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,613
and many, many other things.

206
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,158
After those 12 weeks,
some of you will be police officers...

207
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,910
and some of you will not.

208
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,328
Some of you will be...

209
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,706
Here at the Academy...

210
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,793
Here at the Academy...

211
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,753
you will learn...

212
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,546
You will learn...

213
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,091
Princess. Princess. Come here.

214
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,551
Princess?
Looks more like a prince to me.

215
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,306
- Give me that dog.
- Ahem. But he's mine, sir.

216
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,682
He's a queer.

217
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,437
Cadets, proceed to the supply room
and draw your uniforms.

218
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,733
Fall out. Let's go. Move it.
Move it, move it, move it.

219
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,658
- Next.
- What about guns? When do we get guns?

220
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,326
Next.

221
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,372
- I'm a size 9, sometimes a size 10.
- Next.

222
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,425
Hey! You three dirtbags report
to the Academy barber...

223
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,094
before you do anything else.

224
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,679
Where's that?

225
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,265
Find it, rat face.

226
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,808
Rat face?

227
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,894
- He probably meant the other guy.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

228
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,147
- What's that?
- That's where the commandant...

229
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,399
- And his wife live.
- Nice.

230
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,985
Oh. Excuse me.
Do you know where we get our clothes?

231
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,238
Yeah. You gotta go right over there.

232
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,906
- Here? Okay, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

233
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,118
- Go in and tell them Mahoney sent you.
- Got it.

234
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,997
- Be out of here by 3:00.
- Move it, dirtbag. I'm first.

235
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,249
And I'm next.

236
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,795
For important guys like you, I'll wait.

237
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,093
Okay, let's go. Take it all off.

238
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,469
You got it.

239
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,154
Hello?

240
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:32,313
- Just a little off the side, please.
- You bet.

241
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,817
- You can do that?
- Sure. This ain't the Army, you know.

242
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,826
Let's go, let's go! We've got to find
you little babies a place to sleep.

243
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,704
Better listen up, you fart-blossoms.

244
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,708
- You sure you said Mahoney?
- Yeah, I even spelled it to her.

245
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,585
- Copeland and Blankes, in here.
- Sir.

246
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,672
This man is my personal physician.
I can't live without him, sir.

247
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,591
Right down here,
I want Fackler and Martin.

248
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,343
I've known him since childhood...

249
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:07,306
- Right here, Mahoney and Tackleberry.
- Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

250
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,435
Thank you.
I've always wanted to live with a nut.

251
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,854
My pleasure.

252
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,857
- Mahoney, is it?
- Yes, sir. I'd like to say one more...

253
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:21,028
The rest of you wimps come with me.
Move it, move it, move it.

254
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,488
Wimps?

255
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,412
- You're married?
- Yeah.

256
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,872
That's beautiful, man.

257
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,208
To me, marriage is a sacred institution.

258
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,711
So tell me.

259
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,588
You and the wife do it doggie-style
or what?

260
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,774
Room ready for inspection, sir.

261
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,986
Good haircuts, men.

262
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,030
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

263
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,407
Damn good haircuts.

264
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,326
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

265
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,250
Men...

266
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,627
I've got a little problem.

267
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,715
It seems I've got a squad
full of scumbuckets.

268
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,051
A whole big bunch of losers.

269
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,138
And I was kind of hoping
that you two fine, young cadets...

270
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,933
might help me to just get rid of
a few of them.

271
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,396
What do you say?
Will you help me out?

272
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,442
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

273
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,656
- Good.
- I'm Copeland, sir. Chad Copeland.

274
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,159
Good for you.

275
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,332
Hi, I'm Douglas Fackler.
I always wanted to be a cop.

276
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,017
Lieutenant Hoffman, Lieutenant Hoffman...

277
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,269
report immediately to the infirmary.

278
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,814
Hey, Thompson. Well?

279
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,650
- How do I look?
- That wasn't very funny this morning.

280
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,319
Wasn't funny.
I'd give anything to see your thighs.

281
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,571
Don't suppose you'd
describe them for me.

282
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:32,284
Well, they're tan, of course.
Very supple, well-rounded...

283
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,329
and luxuriant to the touch.

284
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,580
Mm.

285
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,583
Absolute silence!

286
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,176
My name is Lt. Harris...

287
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,720
in case you missed it.

288
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,061
This is Sgt. Callahan...

289
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,397
in case you missed it.

290
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,693
We are the meanest instructors here.

291
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:11,782
We've got you because
you are the worst people here.

292
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,579
You people are D-Squad.

293
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,290
D for dirtbags.

294
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:24,378
When I say, "Hey, dirtbags,"
that means you.

295
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:29,049
You people are going to hate my guts
for the rest of your lives.

296
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:34,305
I am going to make you sorry
that you ever came here.

297
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,476
Now, it is traditional here at the Academy
for each squad...

298
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,020
to have two student squad-leaders.

299
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:46,025
I have chosen Cadets Blankes
and Dopeland. Step out, men.

300
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,237
If these two cadets give you an order...

301
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,074
obey it.

302
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,246
Now, I thought it would be nice...

303
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:03,292
if we were to close out
our first afternoon together...

304
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,671
with a nice little stroll
around the campus.

305
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,347
Move out, maggots!

306
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,941
- Holy, shit.
- This is definitely not Ecuador.

307
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,947
Get up, Barbara. Get up. Get up.

308
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,615
Move it, move it, move it.

309
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,244
I could show a movie on your butt, fatso.

310
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,913
Nineteen. Twenty!

311
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,919
More! I want more!

312
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,547
Fifteen.

313
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,757
Sixteen.

314
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,134
Seventeen.

315
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:59,098
Eighteen. Let's go. Let's go.

316
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,477
Nine. Ten.

317
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,525
Attention. Lights out in 10 minutes.

318
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,653
Lights out in 10 minutes.

319
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,064
Game over.

320
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,659
Asshole.

321
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,663
Police work...

322
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,875
is what...

323
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,210
you are...

324
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,381
here for.

325
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,177
Arrest...

326
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:22,848
procedures...

327
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,561
traffic violations...

328
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,022
high-speed...

329
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,358
driving...

330
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,610
self-defense.

331
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:40,532
And you will have many examinations...

332
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,244
which you must pass.

333
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,497
Plus...

334
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:51,377
you will endure an extremely rigorous
physical training program.

335
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,588
Do you know what that means, Hooks?

336
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,217
I'm not sure, sir.

337
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,010
What?

338
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,807
Voice commands.

339
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,936
We will learn to use our voices
with authority.

340
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,105
Won't we, Hooks?

341
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:19,780
Now, have any of you
had any military training?

342
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,784
Mm-hm?

343
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:28,288
I served with the U.S. Army
Airborne 209th Special Forces Unit.

344
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,082
Anybody else?

345
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,542
What?

346
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,838
You have had prior
military training, Mahoney?

347
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,174
- Well, yes, but not in this life, sir.
- What?

348
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,386
In a previous life, I served
with Her Majesty's Forces in India.

349
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,223
- Interesting sideline...
- If you're trying to get thrown out...

350
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

351
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,103
Impossible?
What the hell's going on here?

352
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,272
I'll have to see
the commandant about this.

353
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,611
You will also learn the Municipal Code.
And you will learn them by heart.

354
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,613
Cadet Mahoney. Cadet Mahoney.

355
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,534
Report immediately to the commandant's
office. Cadet Mahoney.

356
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:11,665
Okay, Mahoney, get going. On the double.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

357
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,002
Now...

358
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,962
Lieutenant Harris, Lieutenant Harris...

359
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,048
report immediately to the firing range.
Lieutenant Harris.

360
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,677
Excuse me.

361
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,471
Callahan, take over.

362
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,309
Howdy.

363
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,978
- No one's allowed in here.
- Listen.

364
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,522
- I got a problem, chief.
- It's commandant.

365
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,525
Commandant, I'm sorry.
Is that your fish?

366
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,819
- No, it belongs to a friend.
- Very pretty.

367
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,614
- What do you want?
- I want out of here. Right now.

368
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,909
- Out of this office?
- No, out of the Academy.

369
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,995
- That's no problem. You can just quit.
- I can't quit.

370
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,873
Of course you can.
Many, many wonderful people...

371
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,083
- Have quit many, many...
- Commandant?

372
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,169
Do you know Capt. Reed?

373
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:01,924
Oh, yes. Capt. Reed. You're Mahoney.

374
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,262
Mahoney. Mahoney. Mahoney.

375
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,266
- You're a special case. You can't quit.
- I know that.

376
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,561
- On the other hand, I can't throw you out.
- Why not?

377
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,732
I promised Capt. Reed. I promised
I'd keep you here the full 24 weeks.

378
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,028
You what? You what? You told...?

379
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,781
He told me that I could...

380
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,578
- I'm trapped here?
- Well, yes. We all are.

381
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,208
Pick it up, pick it up.
Keep moving up that hill.

382
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,920
Put some muscle in it.

383
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,923
Get those knees up.
Get those knees up, come on!

384
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,978
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

385
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,980
This is definitely not for me.

386
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,862
Keep going!

387
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:22,796
Come on, Hooks, get over the wall.
Move it, move it, move it.

388
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,675
Come on, Hooks, get up.

389
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,846
Skip it. Go around. You'll never make it.
Why don't you quit now?

390
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,932
Quit, quit, quit. You'll never make it.

391
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,146
Sir, I'm terribly sorry,
but I seem to have ripped my pants.

392
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,361
Don't try me, punk.

393
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,781
Now, wise guy...

394
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,034
you run, don't trot...

395
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:56,538
to the supply room,
and you get a new pair.

396
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,625
Yes, sir. I'll be back later in the day.

397
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,170
Be back in five minutes!

398
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,173
Yes, sir. Shit, I'm deaf.

399
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,353
Hey, you got any brown shoe-polish?

400
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,104
I've got cordovan. Who's it for?

401
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,190
Lieutenant Harris.

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,543
Sir! Look, sir, new pants.

403
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,671
What are you doing...? Give me that.

404
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,925
All right, you scumbags, you have
30 minutes to shower and get to class.

405
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,678
Let's go. Move it. Move it. Move it.

406
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,013
Pick it up. Pick it up.

407
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,058
Pick it up, assholes.

408
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,610
So far, nobody's quit.

409
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,861
But they will.

410
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,138
Well, well, well.

411
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,100
I told you not to try me, boy.

412
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,769
Stand up.

413
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,649
Now, I want you two squad leaders...

414
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,944
to take Mr. Mahoney here
and run him until he throws up.

415
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,154
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,532
And then, just after he throws up...

417
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,034
run him some more.

418
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,910
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

419
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,374
You are going to learn, Mahoney...

420
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,793
that nobody...

421
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,130
nobody...

422
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,466
screws...

423
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,801
with me.

424
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,013
- Pick it up, pick it up! Come on!
- Hey, this is great.

425
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,973
- Two assholes, no waiting.
- Move it!

426
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,560
Chad, would you please just let me
yell at him without interrupting?

427
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,105
- Sure.
- Come on, Mahoney! Move it, move it!

428
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,365
Bang!

429
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,878
Son, where did you get this gun?

430
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,006
My mom gave it to me.

431
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,968
Can I borrow it for a little while?

432
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,011
Sure.

433
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:47,060
Left, left right left.
Left, left, left right left.

434
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:53,900
You will learn to defend yourselves
without stick or firearm.

435
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,570
I need a volunteer.

436
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,823
- Barbara, get out here.
- I just ate.

437
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,119
Right where I'm standing.
Right here. Right now.

438
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,541
All right, come at me
with an imaginary knife.

439
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,917
Do I have to?

440
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,588
Yes, you do. I'm not joking.

441
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,507
Come on. Come on.

442
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,468
Now!

443
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,888
Ouch! Ouch!

444
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,478
Okay. That's how it's done. Who's next?

445
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,772
- Pick me!
- I'd love it. I'd love to go.

446
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,192
I'd love to go. We'll both go.

447
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,611
You have 20 minutes
to complete the test.

448
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,989
Try to answer as many questions
as possible.

449
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,533
All right, start.

450
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,506
All right, here we go.
The count's at two. Here's the pitch.

451
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,383
Swung on and missed!

452
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,845
Struck out.

453
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,821
Well, it was Saturday night
And I was feeling all right

454
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,823
Looking for my buttercup

455
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,745
They were dancing next door
On the thirteenth floor

456
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,742
You know, Mahoney...

457
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,372
I'd like to spend the next month
breaking you into little pieces.

458
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,958
But I won't...

459
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,210
because you're bad.

460
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,879
You're bad for morale, Mahoney.

461
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,633
You look like the sweet little boy
from next door.

462
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,011
Ha. But you don't fool me. Oh, no.

463
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,556
No, you're the devil,
and you're rotten to the core.

464
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,391
And you're ruining my chances...

465
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,477
of training some men
who might make pretty good cops.

466
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,229
I agree. I've been saying that.

467
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,482
- You make me sick.
- Thank you, sir. I make everybody sick.

468
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,403
We're going to pick up this telephone
and call your buddy Capt. Reed.

469
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,074
And you. You are going to help me
talk him out of this terrible mistake.

470
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,076
Terrific. I'll do my part.

471
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,370
You're damn right you will.

472
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,249
Ha.

473
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,882
This is the Academy.
I'd like to speak to a Capt. Reed.

474
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,926
Reed!

475
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,892
Captain Reed? Yes, sir.
How are you, sir?

476
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,937
This is Lt. Harris, Lt. Thaddeus Harris
out at the Police Academy.

477
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,982
I'm so sorry to disturb you, sir...

478
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,111
but your friend Cadet Mahoney
would like to speak with you.

479
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,198
Just one moment, please. Mahoney.

480
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,242
- Mahoney!
- Oh, yeah.

481
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,454
Hi, Captain Reed? Can I get out of here?

482
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,331
No? Okay.

483
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,291
I tried.

484
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,463
Captain Reed, thank you so much.

485
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,382
Yes. Goodbye. Yes.

486
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,095
I don't know
what you're trying to do.

487
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,263
I don't know why you're here.

488
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,225
But you'll never be a cop
as long as I live.

489
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,185
- Don't want to be.
- Get your butt off my desk.

490
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,270
And get out of here!

491
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,816
Mahoney!

492
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,693
I've already told you once.

493
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,696
Nobody screws with me.

494
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,158
Well, maybe you'll meet the right girl
and all that'll change.

495
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,786
Get out of here now!

496
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,209
Come on, Mahoney.
Harris said you had to do a hundred.

497
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,631
Hey, Mahoney.

498
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,843
Here's a pair of my old sweat socks.
I wore them all day.

499
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,178
That should help you to get up.

500
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,856
You did it.

501
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,109
You son of a bitch.

502
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,966
This is a hell of a way
to spend my evenings.

503
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,679
I can't feel my arms anymore.

504
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,102
Hey, Barbara, come here.

505
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,770
- Me?
- Yeah, come here.

506
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,315
- What?
- Come on, right here.

507
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,486
- I want you to give me your best shot.
- What?

508
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,112
I want you to hit me. Best shot.

509
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,614
- Hit you?
- Yeah, come on.

510
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,283
- Ha, ha. No, really, I...
- Hit me.

511
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,577
- Really, when I...
- Do it now. Come on.

512
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,663
- I can't. Because when I...
- Do it. Give me your...

513
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,541
How was that? Was that okay?

514
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,919
Yeah.

515
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,171
Yeah, that's good.

516
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:58,139
This weekend is your first leave
from the Academy.

517
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:03,353
When you go, wherever it is
you filthbags go...

518
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,607
do take note of how nice things are
on the outside.

519
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,153
Do give serious consideration
to not coming back.

520
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,447
Four of you have already quit.

521
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,575
And that's just the beginning.

522
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,578
Ten-hut!

523
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,163
Dismissed.

524
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,625
Heard him, dismissed! Let's go.

525
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,587
They'll get together for a party.
They always do.

526
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,631
You go with them.

527
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:36,052
Whenever they get out of line,
give me a ring.

528
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,227
Hi, Leslie.

529
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,647
Studying hard?

530
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,190
Yup.

531
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,901
Where's the party going to be
this weekend?

532
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,486
Party?

533
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,780
Party? I don't know anything
about a party.

534
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,491
I'm going home for the weekend
and visit my mom and dad.

535
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,953
Now, if you don't mind,
I do have to study.

536
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,873
You know, Chad?
I don't think we've got his full attention.

537
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,544
So why don't you take his books
and throw them out the window?

538
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,505
My pleasure, Kyle.

539
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,059
Find out where the party is.

540
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,062
- How?
- Ask Mahoney.

541
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,440
- Mahoney.
- Mahoney.

542
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,152
Thousand eleven, 1012, 1013...

543
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,031
Mahoney.

544
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,533
Could I speak to you outside
for just a second?

545
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,201
Yeah.

546
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,081
What's up?

547
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,208
Mahoney.

548
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,295
Is there a party this weekend?

549
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,922
Yeah, of course there is.
Do you want to come?

550
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,091
No. No, I can't.

551
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,762
I just need to know where it is.
Sorry to be asking.

552
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,847
Then why are you asking?

553
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,059
Some people want to know.

554
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,729
Okay, yeah. It's no big secret.
It's at the Blue Oyster bar.

555
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,273
It's on Howell.

556
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,379
Hey, big boy
Why don't you come up

557
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,047
And see me sometime?

558
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,511
Hey, big boy

559
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,740
So, what about you, Hightower?
What are you doing at the Academy?

560
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,076
I got bored with my chosen profession.

561
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,870
- What was that?
- I was a florist.

562
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,080
A florist?

563
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,958
You know, flowers and shit.

564
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,627
Oh, yeah.

565
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,515
- Hi.
- Hi.

566
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,605
- I didn't think you'd show up.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

567
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,286
Do you want to go for a walk?

568
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,871
- Walk.
- Oh, yeah.

569
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,040
Are you kidding? Of course.

570
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,187
- Can you tell me something?
- Yeah?

571
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,648
Why do you want to be a cop?

572
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,738
I like to dress like a man.

573
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,991
Me too.

574
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:17,834
Tonight you're mine completely

575
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:25,424
You give your love so sweetly

576
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:32,807
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

577
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:39,605
But will you love me tomorrow?

578
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:46,404
Is this a lasting treasure

579
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:53,828
Or just a moment's pleasure?

580
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:09,552
Okay, let's go. Move it. Move it. Let's go.

581
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,601
Two lines, right here.

582
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,520
The first one on the step,
the second one off.

583
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,818
I said two lines, dummy!
Now step it up, step it up, let's go.

584
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,236
Hey.

585
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,656
Why didn't you call me this weekend?

586
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,370
Well nothing really happened, sir.

587
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,206
There was a party, wasn't there?

588
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,751
Yes, sir.

589
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,878
Well, what went on?

590
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,007
Dancing, sir.

591
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,634
Mostly dancing.

592
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,099
Dancing?

593
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,690
Hightower, you're first. Let's go.

594
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,661
Come with me.

595
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,231
Ready now, sir.

596
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,696
Thank you.

597
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,240
I got him.

598
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,416
Tackleberry. You're next.

599
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,932
Come with me.

600
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,692
- Hey!
- Tackleberry!

601
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,434
Holy shit.

602
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,314
Get back here.

603
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,531
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

604
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,329
- Don't worry, I can explain everything.
- Shut up.

605
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,999
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

606
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,667
Yes, ma'am.

607
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,922
You've been sneaking in here
every night for weeks.

608
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,965
What? No.

609
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:39,053
What do you think
I ought to do about this?

610
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,889
Well, let's see.

611
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,979
My God.

612
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,859
Sir.

613
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,695
Ma'am.

614
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:11,710
A police officer must generate
respect and confidence.

615
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,713
His or her voice, Hooks...

616
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,592
has a great deal to do with that.
Hooks, get up. Stand right over here.

617
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,845
Today, Hooks.

618
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:26,016
Now, here is the house.

619
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,310
Here is the window.

620
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,397
And I am a burglar.

621
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,900
I am coming out of the window...

622
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,404
with a stolen stereo in my hand.

623
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,907
I'm coming out of the window,
over the hedge...

624
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,326
and you are the arresting officer.

625
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,162
What do you say, Hooks?

626
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,957
Don't move! This is a stickup.

627
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,085
Stickup?

628
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,714
I mean, police... Police officer. Stop.

629
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,134
Sit down, Hooks.

630
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,802
Sit, sit, sit.

631
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,474
Tackleberry, you try it. Same situation.

632
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,145
All right. Here is the house.
Here is the window.

633
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,441
I'm the burglar. I'm coming out
of the house, over the hedge...

634
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,818
I've got the stolen stereo in my hands.

635
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:22,156
Drop that stereo before I blow
your goddamn nuts off, asshole!

636
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:30,206
Tackleberry, we really need to talk.

637
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,667
Mahoney, let me ask you a question.

638
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,838
Have you ever had a woman just...

639
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,550
throw you down
and screw your goddamn brains out?

640
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,052
No.

641
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,638
It happened to me last night.

642
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,933
Really? How was it?

643
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,769
I think...

644
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,314
I'm in love.

645
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,486
- How many girls were there?
- Just one.

646
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,196
Just one?

647
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,033
You made love to just one girl?

648
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,701
That's disgusting.

649
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,578
Yeah, I know.

650
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,792
- Hey, George, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

651
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,796
Every now and then...

652
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,507
you seem to lose your Spanish accent.

653
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,592
What's up?

654
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,679
Yeah. Every now and then.

655
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,307
Can you keep a secret?

656
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,850
Oh, yeah.

657
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,728
I'm not really George Martin.

658
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:39,692
I'm just plain old George Martin,
fourth-generation American. Ha, ha.

659
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,611
- Really?
- I just use the accent to get the girls.

660
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,116
Does it work?

661
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,707
- Barbara!
- He's in the gym.

662
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,251
You're gonna pay for sending us
to the wrong party.

663
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,212
- I'll tell him.
- Not just pushups, either, Leslie.

664
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,049
We're gonna get your fat ass
thrown out of here. That's a promise!

665
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,759
- How?
- How?

666
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,052
You'll find out.

667
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,805
Mahoney isn't the only one here
who can play tricks.

668
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,182
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
These ain't track shoes.

669
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,642
Yeah, I know. Just hurry up.

670
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,479
I'm as anxious as you.
I'm not comfortable in these surroundings.

671
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,606
- Yeah, well, come on up.
- Up here?

672
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,443
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, listen, when do I get my money?

673
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,570
When the job's over,
for crying out loud.

674
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,958
That's good, Hightower.
Why don't you just sit down over there?

675
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,923
All right, you scumballs,
30 minutes to room inspection.

676
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,926
Move it. Move it. Move it.

677
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:53,057
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

678
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:00,439
Got a light?

679
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:05,277
I don't smoke. Ha, ha.
I have a friend who smokes. I'll go get him.

680
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,407
Mahoney, major problem.

681
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,624
Well, my goodness.

682
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,217
Would you please just calm down
and take it easy?

683
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,264
I just like to do it in strange places,
that's all. Okay?

684
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,891
Why the hell didn't you say so?

685
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,938
You'll find this academy one of the most
comprehensive in the country.

686
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:45,651
I could point out many,
many, many features to you.

687
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,279
- Squeeze in here. Yeah.
- In here?

688
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,490
- You want to do it in a podium?
- All my life.

689
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,534
- Right. Where you going?
- I'll be back.

690
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,621
I'm not the customer. The real customer
will be here any second now, okay?

691
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,623
Oh, okay.

692
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,959
Gentlemen, please follow me.

693
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,670
We have a very, very fine...

694
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,172
slide presentation for you.

695
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,342
Please take your seats.

696
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,762
I think you'll find
there's plenty of room for everybody.

697
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,181
Thank you.

698
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,480
First of all, I'd like to say
how sorry I am...

699
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,899
that everybody could not make it today.

700
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:30,529
For those here, I think you'll find
the presentation interesting...

701
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,365
as well as very, very stimulating.

702
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,210
Could we have the lights turned down?

703
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,214
Now, this first slide...

704
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,967
shows a very...

705
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,303
very interesting thing:

706
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,181
Our main building.

707
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,894
In slide two...

708
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,190
we see...

709
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,901
another view...

710
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,445
of it.

711
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,407
Oh, my God. You wouldn't believe it.

712
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,794
Let us look at this slide for a moment,
without comment.

713
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,214
I think it speaks for itself.

714
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,022
Could we have the lights, please?

715
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,694
Well.

716
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:57,616
I hope this was as much fun for you
as it was for me.

717
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,120
Let's have lunch, shall we?

718
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,708
And maybe, smoke a cigarette.

719
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,066
Good speech.

720
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,599
What do you intend to do
about Mahoney?

721
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,684
- What's he done?
- What's he done?

722
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,980
I'll tell you what he's done. He...

723
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,985
Yes, sir?

724
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,362
He did a very, very bad thing.

725
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,157
To whom, sir?

726
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,242
To whom?

727
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,706
Yes, sir.

728
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,501
Well, I don't know.

729
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,254
Are you all right, sir?

730
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,466
No, not really. May I go?

731
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,927
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

732
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,846
You're welcome.

733
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:50,228
Left, right, left. Left. Left.

734
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,948
Left, right, left. Left.

735
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:21,301
Left, right, left.
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

736
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:26,056
From now on, part of your training
will be to ride, from time to time...

737
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,643
in actual squad cars
with actual police officers...

738
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,603
in actual situations.

739
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,648
And you'd better actually
keep your mouths shut.

740
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,275
And your eyes and your ears open.

741
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:41,113
Say, Mahoney,
why don't you ride with me?

742
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:48,203
Well, move it, cretins!
Move it, move it, move it!

743
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:52,290
Lieutenant Harris, I've changed
my mind. I want to be a cop.

744
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,419
- Never, punk.
- Why not? All I have to do is behave...

745
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,629
Get out of this car, Mahoney.
You hear me?

746
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:02,259
You get. Get, Mahoney.
You get out there and you follow me.

747
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,970
You stay right behind me, punk.

748
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,062
Oh, how I love a ride in the country.

749
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,615
Officer. Officer.

750
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,618
Can you get my kitty-cat out of the tree?

751
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,414
No problem, ma'am.

752
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,499
Oh, no. No, wait.

753
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,259
What the hell is this?

754
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,519
I'll be right back. I'm sorry.

755
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,864
What the hell is going on down there?

756
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,283
Move it!

757
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,370
Assholes.

758
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,998
Hey! Hey, you, give me that bike.

759
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,461
Come on, move it. This is official
police business. Move it out. Let's go.

760
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,047
- It's new.
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt it.

761
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,567
My God.

762
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,070
Someone call a veterinarian.

763
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,245
Your new hat, sir.

764
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,261
You told no one?

765
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,346
Not a soul.

766
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:17,120
Hightower? Hightower?

767
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,538
I need to talk.

768
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,749
That's terrific, Hightower, but it's...

769
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:24,419
It's 2:30 in the morning.

770
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,672
- The driving course is tomorrow.
- So?

771
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,633
I haven't driven a car since I was 12.

772
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,426
Really? You're kidding.

773
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:36,348
If I don't pass this driving course,
they're gonna kick me out. Harris said so.

774
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,645
All right. Let's go.

775
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,231
Sleeping is for fags.

776
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:49,527
First thing we gotta do is steal a car.
Copeland's should do.

777
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,784
Okay, your turn.

778
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,495
Now, you've got to remember
to drive defensively...

779
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:03,208
or offensively, depending
on your needs. Let's go.

780
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,009
Comfy?

781
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:14,886
- No.
- All right.

782
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,389
Let's just move the seat back a little.

783
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:21,059
On second thought, let's rip
the front seats out and sit in the back.

784
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,369
I was kidding about the front seat.
But this is good.

785
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,871
It's different. Comfort's important.

786
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:50,338
Put it into first. Right. Little more.
Okay, you can go a little faster now.

787
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:56,761
Yeah. Yeah, you're doing beautifully.
You feel it? You feel what's going on?

788
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,556
You can even
turn off the windshield wipers.

789
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,434
Yeah, that's it.

790
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,979
Okay, now there's another car.

791
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,858
Hightower?

792
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,738
Hightow...? What...?
You didn't hit the brakes.

793
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:17,032
You didn't tell me to.

794
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,783
You idiot!

795
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:22,078
You bastard! You dumb shit!

796
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,384
- Pull over and let me drive for a while.
- No, not now.

797
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,178
This is fun.

798
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,725
- Pull over.
- No, I'm getting out of here.

799
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,505
Holy shit!

800
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,988
Attaboy, Hightower.

801
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,379
Taught him everything he knows.

802
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:08,935
Not bad.

803
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,063
Miss Hooks, you're next.

804
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,398
Hurry up!

805
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,067
Thanks, Mahoney. You saved my life.

806
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,820
- Maybe someday you'll save mine.
- Any time.

807
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,156
You're next. Yellow line. Yellow line.

808
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,075
You better not cry

809
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,746
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

810
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,934
Wee!

811
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,436
Oh, this is fun.

812
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:00,111
What is it? What is it?

813
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,238
She ran over my feet.

814
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,782
I'm sorry. I really am.

815
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,870
Sorry? You dumb, fat jigaboo!

816
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,208
Oh, shit.

817
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,301
- At ease, Hightower. At ease.
- It's okay, Hightower.

818
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,846
- He didn't mean it. He was joking.
- Take it easy, now. Hightower!

819
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,514
Hightower, don't do that.

820
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:33,811
If you don't stop, you are out of here.
I am warning you, Hightower!

821
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,824
You messed up big, mister.

822
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:51,329
Now you get your stuff
and get out of here, right now.

823
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,623
Get!

824
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:59,545
Attention,
applications for motorcycle service...

825
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:03,049
should be turned in
at the Administration building by Friday.

826
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,927
Applications for motorcycle service
should be turned in...

827
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,097
One down, several to go.

828
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,940
Copeland, get out of that car.

829
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,701
Mahoney.

830
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,997
It's got to be Mahoney.

831
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,627
I know, I know. Come on.

832
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,343
Out of all the people I thought would
make it, Hightower was the one.

833
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:51,222
I mean, if all the cops looked like him,
there'd be no crime at all.

834
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,058
I'm getting sick of this place.

835
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,061
How're you doing, "Ma-homo"?

836
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,230
Don't fool with me.
Not in the mood.

837
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,898
You wrecked my car.

838
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,736
No, Hightower did. Why don't you
go see him? That'd be a matchup.

839
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,030
Because we want you.

840
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:11,075
Okay, how about 12:00 midnight?
Nine o'clock on the coast.

841
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:15,621
No, no. I'm talking right now, Mahoney.
Let's go. You throw the first punch.

842
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,332
Cadet could get thrown out...

843
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,001
- For hitting another cadet.
- Oh, really?

844
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,212
I thought you wanted to get thrown out.

845
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,256
Here's your chance.

846
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:28,968
No.

847
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:34,599
Now, Mahoney, I'm going to rub this
right in your face.

848
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,351
On your mark...

849
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,394
get set...

850
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,201
- Wait, you guys! Wait!
- What the hell...?

851
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,162
Who threw the first punch?

852
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,748
- That's all I want to know.
- Barbara did.

853
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,584
- Barbara?
- That's right, sir.

854
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,671
Then he's out of here.
Him and his queer dog.

855
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:09,133
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Barbara didn't throw the first punch.

856
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,802
- He did so.
- I threw the punch.

857
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,179
Mahoney, you're out
of your mind. Lieutenant...

858
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:17,433
- Blankes, who'd you rather have out?
- Is that true, Blankes?

859
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,521
Did Mahoney start it?

860
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,984
Yes, sir. Mahoney started it.

861
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:32,031
Then, Mahoney, my little piss-ant...

862
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,868
you are out of the Academy...

863
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,995
forever.

864
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,707
Get your stuff.

865
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,252
And get out.

866
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,004
Too bad, so sad, bye-bye.

867
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,855
Does the radio bother you?

868
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,068
I could turn it down.

869
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,453
Here, I brought you an apple.

870
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,414
Thanks.

871
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,838
Hey, man, what...?

872
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:52,403
My God. Here, take this.

873
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,156
Hey, free TV's.

874
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,372
Hey, everybody! There's a riot going on.

875
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,839
My livelihood! You're ruining me!

876
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,926
What do you got there?
What are you doing with that TV?

877
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,560
- Hi. Want a ride?
- No, thanks.

878
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,826
Hey, did you two hear the news...

879
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,495
- On the radio?
- No.

880
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,623
- A riot's broken out downtown.
- How come?

881
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,583
Who knows how these things
get started?

882
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:50,002
Attention! All cadets report immediately...

883
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,796
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

884
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,967
Repeat, all cadets report immediately
to the parking lot in full riot gear.

885
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,301
This is not a drill.

886
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,304
- Jones! Was that you?
- No, man.

887
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,058
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

888
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:08,938
Get out there fast!
Move it, move it, move it!

889
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,107
Let's go, let's go.

890
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:28,541
This is it. This is the big one.

891
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,043
It's time this cop...

892
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,379
met the public.

893
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,847
All right, listen up.
Here's the situation. There is a state...

894
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:46,225
of general disorder
in the Oakfield section of town.

895
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,519
Real police are handling the problem.

896
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,856
We are being sent
to a peripheral safe area.

897
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,860
Our job will be merely to divert traffic
away from the trouble zone...

898
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,321
and to protect public property.

899
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,114
You will have live ammunition...

900
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,199
but there will be no call to use it.

901
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:06,203
Tackleberry, do you understand,
numb nuts?

902
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,913
Yes, sir.

903
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,548
Come on!

904
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,847
We are now entering
the expressway at Belmont.

905
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:28,392
Very good. Your bus is to deploy
on Sixteenth Street...

906
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,519
between 4th and 8th Avenues.

907
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,022
Sixteenth Street? Are you sure, sir?

908
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,650
Of course I'm sure.
I never forget a number.

909
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,277
Yes, sir.

910
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,363
There's nobody around.

911
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,908
I guess they're hiding.

912
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,382
All right, let's go, dirtbags, unload it.
Let's move it.

913
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:02,301
I want two lines right here.
Come on, dummies.

914
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,846
Let's go, let's go.

915
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,769
You, one block over, one block up.

916
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,146
You, one block down.

917
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,651
You, one block up. You, one block over.

918
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:23,114
You, one block over. Let's go. Let's go.

919
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,491
If you have to make an arrest...

920
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,285
do it as quietly as possible.

921
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,290
Boy, it sure is quiet around here?

922
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,308
Hey, Fackler. How's it going?

923
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,352
Oh, just fine, thanks.

924
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:59,316
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We're from the Academy.

925
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:03,404
You're supposed to be blocks away.
The damn riot's right down this street.

926
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,448
We're pulling out.

927
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,746
I love sushi. I'm into back-rubs,
all kinds of Japanese stuff.

928
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,165
My car stereo, it's a Sony.

929
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:17,585
I got a good friend, his father was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

930
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,505
Hey, maybe your family had
something to do with it?

931
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,507
You know sake? The wine?

932
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:27,553
I know a place where they heat it up
before they serve it.

933
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,097
Holy shit.

934
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,516
I got to go now.

935
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:42,818
Run!

936
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:15,351
Hello, men. I thought I'd come by
for a personal inspection.

937
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:18,479
- Okay if we get in, sir?
- I guess so.

938
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,732
Sure, why not?
Well, men, how's it going?

939
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,819
I want you to give me a fix
on the entire situation.

940
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,612
Not that good, sir.

941
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:30,658
Oh, so this is very, very, very bad.

942
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,911
The main thing is not to panic.

943
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,961
Attention! Attention, everybody.

944
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:47,258
Attention. This is Commandant
Eric Lassard of the Police Academy.

945
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:50,636
If you do not disperse immediately,
my men will have to arrest you.

946
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:56,767
You have five seconds to move away.
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

947
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,272
Give me the thing.

948
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,602
You should park cars for a living, sir.

949
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,402
Anybody want any of this?

950
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,237
You want this? You'd die for this.

951
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,406
- You're not so tough now.
- Come and take it.

952
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,909
- How about you? You want this?
- What's the matter?

953
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:59,288
- I'm talking to you, twerp.
- Just too dumb to talk?

954
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,985
Damn it. Look, in here.

955
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,073
Try this one.

956
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:45,918
Help. Help.
This is Cadet Leslie Barbara. Help.

957
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,129
Barbara, this is Lt. Harris.

958
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,547
Just calm down.

959
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,926
I'm being chased by 30 rioters.

960
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,554
Barbara, just tell me where you are.

961
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,848
I'm passing you now, sir.

962
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,647
Holy shit.

963
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,071
Hi.

964
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,036
Get the cops!

965
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,352
Okay. Hold it right there, guys.

966
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,438
Why, if it isn't Leslie Barbara...

967
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:50,107
- The police officer.
- Yeah.

968
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,152
Come on, Les,
you're not going to shoot us.

969
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:56,405
You wouldn't shoot old friends,
would you?

970
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,537
No.

971
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,956
Les.

972
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,209
Get lost. We're busy.

973
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:31,607
Now, get the furniture back up there
and get out of the area.

974
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,359
But it's our furniture.

975
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,531
Sorry.

976
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:54,463
Callahan calling Harris. Come in, please.

977
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,215
Harris, come in.

978
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,594
Where the hell is Harris?

979
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,846
- I don't know.
- What?

980
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:05,099
- She doesn't know.
- I heard her.

981
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,728
Run!

982
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,073
Why don't you shoot back?

983
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,955
- Are those gunshots?
- Fucking A.

984
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,751
Shoot back. Come on.

985
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,339
Look up there. See? See?

986
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,842
That looks like Harris up there.

987
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,844
Should we shoot back?

988
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,435
I don't think so.

989
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,774
Come on!

990
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:59,862
Stay there.

991
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:02,531
Mahoney!

992
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:05,450
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

993
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:09,788
I'll bet there's a back door to this place.

994
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:13,167
Hooks. Hooks!
Hooks, get the hell back here.

995
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,210
That's an order.

996
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,474
Freeze!

997
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:13,810
Oh, shit.

998
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,506
Don't move, you bastard.

999
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,801
Run, Thompson! Run!

1000
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:48,929
Put the gun down.

1001
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,432
Let's say you put your gun down.

1002
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:59,773
Lieutenant Harris, any last-minute
tips or suggestions?

1003
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:03,902
Nothing really comes to mind.

1004
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,073
What's it gonna be?

1005
01:28:12,161 --> 01:28:14,204
Throw your gun over the ledge.

1006
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,292
I got two piglet-wigglets.

1007
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,379
Hey!

1008
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,214
What do you want?

1009
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:27,467
I want to watch you off these pigs.

1010
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:36,226
Sure. Ha, ha. Sure.

1011
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,819
Which one do we do first?

1012
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,288
I believe I'd shoot this one.

1013
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,706
Yeah, the old one.

1014
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:11,553
- Looks like cadet revolvers to me.
- I know those guys.

1015
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,643
Don't move, dirtbag!

1016
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,172
Hey. Aw. Hey, hey.

1017
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,424
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's wrong with this man?

1018
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:52,260
There was gunplay, sir, and he missed it.

1019
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,025
- Lieutenant Harris? Captain Reed.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1020
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:10,320
Thank you. I also want to thank you
for looking out for Mahoney.

1021
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,906
It was an honor and a pleasure, sir.

1022
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,117
Thank you, sir. Ha, ha.

1023
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,000
- Could you just...?
- This woman bothering you?

1024
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:27,212
What? No. This is my mother.

1025
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:30,799
Ten-four. Carry on.

1026
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,759
- Oh, my precious...
- Mom, would...?

1027
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,303
- Then at 8:00 you'll meet my mother.
- Right.

1028
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,014
- You'd better have some flowers.
- Flowers, check.

1029
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,437
You men, stop that.

1030
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,734
Oh, well, ha, ha.

1031
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,570
That's more like it, Mahoney.

1032
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:54,739
Good man. Keep up the good work.

1033
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,867
Thank you, sir.

1034
01:30:57,034 --> 01:31:01,246
Ladies and gentlemen, the commandant
of the Academy, Eric Lassard.

1035
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:11,423
So many unusual events have happened
to this graduating class...

1036
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,300
and to me, also.

1037
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,928
I could tell you many, many stories,
but instead...

1038
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:19,306
I have a presentation to make.

1039
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,018
No Academy cadet has ever received
the highest award...

1040
