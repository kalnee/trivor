Why would you ask me that?

335
00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:05,765
His behavior on the rooftop.

336
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,541
It suggested a connection.

337
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,930
The last time Bourne came back,
he exposed the Blackbriar program.

338
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:17,000
It compromised active operations.

339
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:20,042
The Asset was in Syria undercover.

340
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:26,084
He was captured, tortured,
and it took two damn years to get him out.

341
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:29,930
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?

342
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,264
To go public again?

343
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:33,016
I have no idea why he came back.

344
00:35:33,017 --> 00:35:35,018
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

345
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,700
We can't let that happen.

346
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:42,005
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

347
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,671
Yes, sir.

<font color=#ff00ff>[PEOPLE APPLAUDING]</font>

355
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:45,109
Hi.

356
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:51,098
Uh...

357
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,224
You all know why we're here.

358
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:54,101
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.

359
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:58,188
We think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better.

360
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:01,608
We're a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries.

361
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,695
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.

362
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:06,797
<font color=#ff00ff>[AUDIENCE CLAPPING]</font>

363
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:15,831
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

364
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:18,709
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

365
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,585
And what this new platform will do

366
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:24,131
will be to integrate users' data
and preferences,

367
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:26,300
and use that information

368
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:30,345
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

369
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,889
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.

370
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,726
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

371
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:38,145
- ready to ask about privacy.
<font color=#FF551>- MAN</font> Yeah.

372
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:40,564
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.

373
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:44,318
I mean, this is something that matters to us.
And let me just say, uh,

374
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:47,362
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

375
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:51,491
So let me just tell you, when you come
to Deep Dream, when you use our service,

376
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,368
no one will be watching you.

377

<font color=#ff00ff>[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]</font>

<font color=#FF551>DIRECTOR DEWEY:</font> Congratulations.

382
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,615
I hear your stockholders
were very happy with that new platform.

383
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:34,217
And I heard you got hacked.

384
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,954
We're dealing with it.

385
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:40,624
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

386
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,875
I'm out.

387
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,687
Aaron,

388
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,631
you are an extraordinarily gifted
and perceptive young man.

389
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:49,132
When you agreed to help us,

390
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:53,261
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

391
00:40:53,262 --> 00:40:55,243
<font color=#ff00ff>[MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]</font>

392
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:03,146
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm
I'll have on my hands

393
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:05,918
if this arrangement becomes public?

394
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,069
I already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?

395
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,072
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

396
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,491
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.

397
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:18,954
We need a back door into your new
platform, and a way past the encryptions.

398
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:21,896
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

399
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,002
You don't get it, do you?

400
00:41:25,003 --> 00:41:28,005
Privacy is freedom.

401
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:30,424
Maybe that's something
you should think about defending.

402
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:32,592
You little prick, you didn't believe
in privacy or freedom

403
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:35,262
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

404
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:38,181
I paid you back many, many, many times over.

405
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,767
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

406
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,579
I'm out.

407
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,314
I'm done selling out our customers.

408
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:47,626
But you would sell out your country.

409
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:51,194
The truth is, we wouldn't be
having this conversation

410
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:54,448
if you didn't feel personally at risk.

411
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:57,868
You talk about a free Internet,
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

412
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,829
but all you're doing is making it
a much more dangerous place.

413
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,459
And you're sure as hell making
this country much more difficult to defend.

414
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,651
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

415
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:13,650
Accountable.

<font color=#ff00ff>[SNIFFLES]</font>

417
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:35,692

418
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:38,634
Everything on the table.

Bourne has surfaced. In Berlin.

425
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,941
Get the Berlin team up.

426
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,022
Where is she?

427
00:45:55,023 --> 00:45:57,464
She's dead.

428
00:46:00,737 --> 00:46:02,338
She knew the risks.

429
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:05,515
I warned her.

430
00:46:05,783 --> 00:46:07,868
She made a choice.

431
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:10,510
You exploited her.

<font color=#ff00ff>[TIRES SCREECHING]</font>

433
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:28,805
Berlin team is mobile.

434
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,599
What do we have on the location?

435
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,476
It's an address linked to Christian .

436
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:33,602
Anything on Bourne?

437
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:37,374
Nothing yet. I'm accessing CCTV now.

438
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:42,420
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

439
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,591
What if he's not coming for us?

440
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:47,764
What if it's something else?

441
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:52,548
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

442
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:05,113
We should work together, Bourne.

443
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,531
You exposed the Blackbriar program.

444
00:47:09,555 --> 00:47:12,516
We're both after the same thing, right?

445
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:16,948
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.

446
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:20,168
I'm not on your side.

447
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:38,985
CCTV feed is online.

448
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,797
He's on a computer.

449
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:46,091
We have to stop this.

450
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:49,219
If he puts those files online,
operations will be compromised

451
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,429
and people will die.

452
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,281
Yes, sir.

453
00:47:56,853 --> 00:48:00,004
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.

454
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:03,252
These programs have to be exposed.

455
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:06,214
People have a right to know.

456
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:24,524
We need that computer.

457
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:31,678
There's a phone in the room.

458
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,700
I can use it to delete the files.

459
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:01,541
- Got the phone.
- Where's that team?

460
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:02,960
<font color=#FF551>JEFFERS</font> Five minutes out, sir.

463
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:52,115
I've done something.

464
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:54,196
Something...

465
00:49:55,513 --> 00:49:57,824
...that came at a cost.

466
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,953
One day you'll understand why.

467
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:04,662
I gotta get back to Washington.

I wasn't here when you went missing.

Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

488
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,534
Jason, your dad was a patriot.

489
00:53:04,535 --> 00:53:07,204
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

490
00:53:07,205 --> 00:53:10,624
and, like you, he chose to serve his country

491
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,736
out of a profound sense of duty.

492
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:17,130
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.

493
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:19,482
You have to stop this.

494
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:22,242
And you have to stop it now.

00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:23,006
Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance
in the late '90s,

504
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,508
when Bourne was recruited.

505
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:25,759
<font color=#FF551>RUSSELL</font> Is he still active?

506
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,135
<font color=#FF551>JEFFERS</font> He's private security now.

507
00:55:27,136 --> 00:55:30,847
<font color=#FF551>DEWEY:</font> Contact the Asset and tell him I want
him on the ground in London in six hours.

508
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:33,239
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

509
00:55:36,354 --> 00:55:37,688
A mistake? Why?

510
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:41,580
There is an argument for catching Bourne
instead of killing him.

511
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,152
All right, let's hear it.

512
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:47,114
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

513
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:49,783
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

514
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:52,160
He knows things that could help us.

515
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:55,289
Bringing him back in is the smart move.

516
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,832
And how are we going to do that?

517
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:00,002
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.

518
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,796
He concluded Bourne
is still a patriot at heart,

519
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:06,778
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

520
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:09,845
And what are you suggesting?

521
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:12,737
I watched Bourne with those files.

522
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:15,517
Desperately looking into his past.

523
00:56:15,518 --> 00:56:18,729
And I think he's at a tipping point.

524
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:23,713
If I could get face-to-face with him,
I think I can bring him back in.

525
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:25,068
One attempt.

526
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:27,571
And if it fails,

527
00:56:27,572 --> 00:56:30,223
you do what you have to.

528
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:36,473
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

529
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,250
Let's give it a shot.

530
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:41,852
All right, do it.

531
00:56:42,128 --> 00:56:44,880
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.

532
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,006
But this ends now.

No, don't worry about that.

still be buggy this close to launch.

540

Well, I don't think it's buggy.

541
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:35,514
I think we've changed some things
that's going to change the parameters.

542
00:57:35,515 --> 00:57:36,848
We're going to have to go and...

543
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:39,601
Okay, we need to change them back.
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?

544
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:42,479
- Absolutely.
- Look, I think you're right,

545
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,541
- I just don't think we want to...
- I'm tired of waiting.

546
00:57:47,777 --> 00:57:49,194
Mr. Kalloor.

547
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:50,404
What the hell is this?

548
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:52,322
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Burroughs.

00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:54,074
I'm from the Department of Justice.

550
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:56,201
I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint...

551
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:58,662
- Really? We have to do this in public?
- Issued by the US government

552
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:01,832
against Deep Dream Corporation
for violation of the Sherman Act.

553
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:06,044
This complaint requires you to preserve all
personal and corporate financial records

554
00:58:06,045 --> 00:58:09,423
pending antitrust motions
to be filed in federal court.

555
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:11,235
Good day.

- This is Dewey.
- Aaron, it's a message.

558
00:58:25,857 --> 00:58:28,984
And maybe we should think about
what we're doing before it gets any worse.

559
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:32,362
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?

560
00:58:32,363 --> 00:58:35,884
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

561
00:58:36,576 --> 00:58:40,329
I want you to pull up all the records
of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

562
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:44,221
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?

563
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,478
Especially those.

Don't make this personal.

576
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:33,483
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

577
01:00:33,484 --> 01:00:36,069
You know who you're dealing with.

578
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,921

This is Jason Bourne.

I need to talk.

591
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:57,901

I don't work for the Agency anymore.

593

There's no bringing in Bourne.

01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,397
Multiple fire alarms.

674
01:08:50,398 --> 01:08:52,419
That's Bourne.

675
01:08:55,695 --> 01:08:57,556
What do I do?

676
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,760
You stay there. You do not move.

You can't protect me.

680
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:17,549
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

681
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,321
You still have line of sight?

682
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:22,387
I'm on him.

683
01:09:22,388 --> 01:09:26,016
You're gonna shoot him in a crowd
when he's right next to me?

684
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:27,851
Stay where you are, Smith.

685
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:29,645
You know why he's here.

686
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:31,063
He wants answers.

687

You've lost this thing.

688
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,747

Bourne's got Smith.

Go after them.
I'll come around and cut them off.

693

Smith, we know you're with Bourne.

694

He was my father. He started Treadstone.

704

He hired you to put me

Beirut.

726
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,324
I went there to tell him
that Treadstone had approached me.

727
01:11:47,325 --> 01:11:51,014
But if it was his program,
why didn't he say anything to me?

I've done something.

Your father, he wasn't in Operations.

He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

He threatened to expose the program.

He didn't want you turned into a killer.

01:21:02,213 --> 01:21:03,839
Good to meet you.

844
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,571
Can I get one?

845
01:21:07,468 --> 01:21:09,489
Thanks very much for your hard work.

You all set?

852
01:21:49,385 --> 01:21:51,511
Checking the departure route now.

853

You won't have much time.

854

They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.

855
01:21:58,394 --> 01:22:01,271
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing, left hand at my side.

856
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:02,439
You put a bullet in it.

857
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,081
It's better if I'm a target, too.

My protégée. Strongest supporter.

870

You know, after what happened in London,
I did not know what to do with you.

871
01:23:54,552 --> 01:24:00,124
I suppose we'll just, um,
write it off to your learning curve.

872

876
01:24:10,902 --> 01:24:12,569
Of course.

It's tough to stay true

"personal rights versus public safety."

910
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:18,797
This is the great question of our time.

911
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:22,229
And the choices we make about this
will determine our future.

912

to get into tonight,

- Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?

I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

934
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:44,758
A long time ago, I had this idea.

- A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...

937
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:51,056
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

938
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:53,158
It landed two hours ago.

939
01:28:53,601 --> 01:28:55,811
How the hell did he get through immigration?

940
01:28:55,812 --> 01:28:58,689
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

1030

You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,

01:52:15,461 --> 01:52:19,089
and things are changing at the Agency.

1167
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:21,271
What is it you want?

1168
01:52:24,012 --> 01:52:26,453
I know you've always been a patriot.

1169
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:31,031
That what happens to this country
matters to you.

1170
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:34,499
We need you to help protect us.

1171
01:52:35,565 --> 01:52:37,466
Come back in.

1172
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:41,418
And we'll work together.

1173
01:52:48,745 --> 01:52:50,856
Let me think about it.

1174
01:52:51,497 --> 01:52:53,518
How will I find you?

1175
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:41,672
<font color=#FF551>RUSSELL</font>
You still think you can bring him in?

1176
01:53:41,673 --> 01:53:43,944
<font color=#FF551>LEE:</font> I have his trust.

1177
01:53:44,092 --> 01:53:46,363
After what we went through.

1178
01:53:46,803 --> 01:53:48,574
I'll bring him in.

1179
01:53:48,638 --> 01:53:50,739
I'm certain of it.

1180
01:53:51,099 --> 01:53:52,849
<font color=#FF551>RUSSELL</font> And if you can't?

1181
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,451
<font color=#ff00ff>[CAR HORN HONKS]</font>

1182
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,411
<font color=#FF551>LEE:</font> Then he'll have to be put down.
