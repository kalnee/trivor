1
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:03,209
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:05,710
I just got us reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,046
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,883
...our first holiday season
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:14,060
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,427
- Hey!
- Hi!

7
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,262
Pheebs?

8
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:26,028
Skull?

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,536
Yeah, it's my mom's.

10
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,265
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,003
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

12
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:34,703
It belonged to my mom.

13
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,514
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

14
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:42,018
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

15
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,551
And you can put candy in it.

16
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:49,853
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,119
Licorice?

18
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:53,894
Sure.

19
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:57,832
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

20
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,631
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

21
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,637
I mean,
I know Susan does every year...

22
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:05,744
...but I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

23
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,311
And maybe I could teach Ben...

24
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:10,348
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

25
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,546
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

26
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:19,787
Hey.

27
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,863
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

28
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,099
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

29
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:33,600
Lovely.

30
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:37,503
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

31
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,839
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, are you gonna...

32
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,608
...change your last name to "Bing"?

33
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:19,912
No.

34
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,078
Why not?

35
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,288
"Bing" is weird.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,558
Yeah, I know what you mean. Gellar!

37
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,699
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:38,636
Guess what. My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

39
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,329
So I guess I'll be moving out.

40
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,201
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,309
Yes, you will be very sad.

42
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:50,007
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- You guys are gonna live together again?

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,946
- Yeah, why not?
- She's just having so much fun with Joey...

44
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,451
...I just assumed she'd still
be living with him.

45
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,318
Why do you think she's having
so much fun living with Joey?

46
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,790
No reason, except she...

47
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,756
...told me.

48
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,661
Really? She said she didn't want
to live with me?

49
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,594
No. No, she didn't say that.

50
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,498
I think you should talk to Monica now.

51
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,667
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

52
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,468
You're sure?
You're absolutely sure?

53
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:20,044
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,372
Oh, probably?

55
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,945
I don't like that word.

56
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:27,809
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,887
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

58
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,919
You know, "No, the funeral director
probably won't hit on you."

59
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:40,692
"Yeah, that nice couple probably
will adopt you." Okay, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,060
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging all my hopes...

61
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,296
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

62
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:49,133
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

63
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:51,640
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,977
"Bing" doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:03,711
Great, you're home.

66
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,256
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas.

67
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,493
- Drums?
- No, drums!

68
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,103
Hi, could we get
two burritos to go, please?

69
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:32,081
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
because you don't have to live with it.

70
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,652
We have a reservation under
the name Chandler Bing.

71
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:38,518
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,684
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

73
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:44,693
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,124
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,000
- You need to give him money.
- Give him money? It was a joke!

76
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,909
No. To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

77
00:04:57,143 --> 00:05:00,476
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:05,813
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth about it.

79
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,145
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:15,484
We're in a bit of a hurry,
so if you could get us a table...

81
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,357
...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,430
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

83
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,666
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:32,436
Hey. You don't feel...

85
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,603
...like you're gonna throw up, do you?
- No.

86
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,749
Well, I do. So let's...

87
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,385
So, Ben, you...

88
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,055
You know what holiday is coming up,
don't you?

89
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,213
Christmas.

90
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,586
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

91
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,125
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:54,058
Yes, but also...

93
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,092
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:02,069
See, you're part Jewish,
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,971
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,644
Right, but on Hanukkah...

97
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,074
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

98
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,115
See, years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees.

99
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,717
Okay, that's right. Yes...

100
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,220
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

101
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,065
Okay, it's not a contest.

102
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,159
When is Santa coming?

103
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,931
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

104
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,871
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

105
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:39,836
No Santa?

106
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,674
Was I bad?

107
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:45,974
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

108
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,519
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

109
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,122
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

110
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,451
You're his favorite little guy.

111
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,128
So Santa's coming?

112
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,955
Yes!

113
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,823
Santa's coming.

114
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,491
Will he bring me an ant farm?

115
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,562
Will you keep it at Mommy's?

116
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,832
- Okay.
- Then sure!

117
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:14,809
Maybe this slipping-him-money thing
is not gonna work.

118
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,108
Maybe we should just wait.

119
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,946
You're the one who said you would die
if you didn't see Music Man.

120
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,653
I didn't say "die."

121
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,182
I said "cry."

122
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,527
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

123
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,097
Give him a kind word,
shake his hand and give him the money.

124
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,236
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

125
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,334
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

126
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,274
We'd be eating our soup right now.

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,608
Mustached bastard.

128
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:51,608
Okay, those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

129
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:53,441
Excuse me.

130
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,061
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we?

131
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,806
So you like the drums.

132
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,948
That's great.

133
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,079
You know, I was worried that
they would create maybe...

134
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,315
...an unbearable living situation.

135
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:36,588
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

136
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,859
Hey, Pheebs,
we already learned a song.

137
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:42,490
Ready? One, two, three, four.

138
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,237
Tequila!

139
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,668
That's fun.

140
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,538
Here you go.

141
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,852
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

142
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,483
Definitely not easier with coins.

143
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,158
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

144
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,092
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

145
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,291
Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.

146
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,300
Hey, Pheebs...

147
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:22,305
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas
present that disrupts the entire building...

148
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,567
...why not get him something more subtle...

149
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,938
...like a wrecking ball...

150
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:29,775
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

151
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:32,883
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

152
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,815
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

153
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:38,549
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

154
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,350
- I mean, it is so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:46,156
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

156
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,092
Phoebe, you got Joey drums
to annoy Rachel...

157
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,830
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

158
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,000
Maybe on some level.

159
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,713
Joey, you know that you could just
not throw the sticks up in the air.

160
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,911
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

161
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:14,090
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

162
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,861
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

163
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,891
Okay, what is it?

164
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,331
It's a...

165
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:25,869
...tarantula!

166
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:35,140
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

167
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:38,475
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

168
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:42,243
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

169
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,550
What are you talking about?
I love them.

170
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:51,661
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

171
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,561
And then my cat died.

172
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,726
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

173
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,769
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

174
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,266
Oh, isn't that adorable?

175
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,570
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

176
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,179
He's so adorable.

177
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,577
God, he's just so much fun.

178
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,480
Joey's the best.
I'm glad you're having so much fun here.

179
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,914
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,314
What's the matter?

181
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,646
Our apartment is ready.

182
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:23,428
And that makes you angry because?

183
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,254
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

184
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,191
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

185
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:31,769
...said that you were having
so much fun here...

186
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:36,671
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

187
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,979
Phoebe,
did you get all this stuff for Joey...

188
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,308
...to try and drive me out
of the apartment?

189
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,908
You might as well have just
gotten him a fish.

190
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,451
You know how fish freak me out.

191
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:51,917
Fish.

192
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,522
But it wouldn't have mattered.
You and I are gonna live together.

193
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,220
We're roommates.
That's the deal.

194
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:01,060
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

195
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,930
But, okay, if you're having
so much fun over here...

196
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,235
It's so much more fun with you.

197
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:09,168
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We had so much fun.

198
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,867
Remember the time we were playing
with the SuperBall...

199
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:15,537
...and we accidentally threw it through
the window and it broke?

200
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:20,047
I remember paying for the window,
but I don't remember how it broke.

201
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,580
Yeah, stuff like that.

202
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,155
Well, anyway, they say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

203
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,495
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

204
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:32,630
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

205
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,629
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

206
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,406
Done.

207
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,916
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

208
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,556
No, these are my pants.

209
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,885
Okay.

210
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:08,063
- How can I help you?
- Do you have a Santa outfit left?

211
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,462
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

212
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,264
- Did you try Costume City?
- Yeah, I've tried everywhere.

213
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:17,102
- Please, please. I mean, I'll pay extra.
- Sorry. But...

214
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,712
...I do have 74 of them
coming back on the 26th.

215
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:25,111
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

216
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:28,947
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

217
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,214
Come on, you gotta have something.

218
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,892
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

219
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,096
I'm a friend of Santa's...

220
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:43,130
...and he sent me here to wish you...

221
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:46,462
...a merry Christmas!

222
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,767
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

223
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,412
Santa was unavailable...

224
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,549
...so close to Christmas.

225
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,074
Come in, have a seat.

226
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:04,221
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,624
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

228
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,591
I'm Santa's representative...

229
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:15,664
...for all the Southern states.

230
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,996
And Mexico!

231
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:22,130
But Santa sent me here...

232
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:25,969
...to give you these presents, Ben.

233
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,442
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

234
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,124
Wow, thanks!

235
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,764
You're welcome, Ben.

236
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,299
Merry Christmas.

237
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:54,470
And happy Hanukkah!

238
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:59,036
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

239
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:02,609
You are? Me too.

240
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,410
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

241
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,619
You want to wander in the hall?

242
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,522
Hey, Ben!

243
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:17,923
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

244
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:21,656
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

245
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,856
Cool!

246
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,693
Come on, Ben.

247
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,373
Years and years ago...

248
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,838
...there were these people called...

249
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,172
...the Maccabees!
- Ho, ho, ho!

250
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,212
Merry Christmas!

251
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,815
- Santa!
- Hey!

252
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:46,454
What are you doing here, Santa?

253
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:51,188
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy Ben.

254
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,594
What are you doing here...

255
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:57,668
...Weird Turtle Man?

256
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,371
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

257
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,907
...your part-Jewish friend.

258
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:11,213
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

259
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,282
Remember?

260
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,709
What?

261
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,886
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

262
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,720
You bet I did, Ben.

263
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:24,987
Put her there.

264
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:34,365
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

265
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:39,536
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:41,680
Ben, why don't you come open
more presents.

267
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,611
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

268
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,912
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

269
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,055
What are you doing?

270
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,851
You called everyone and said you were
having trouble finding a Santa costume...

271
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:57,222
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

272
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,921
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

273
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,597
- Why?
- Because...

274
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,599
...l'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

275
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,169
...and you're wrecking it.

276
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:10,432
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

277
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,412
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

278
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,682
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

279
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,849
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

280
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,091
Santa? Really?

281
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah, is that okay?

282
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,928
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

283
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,468
- No.
- Then it's okay!

284
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,934
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

285
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,666
Say goodbye.

286
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,472
No, why does he have to go?

287
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:52,980
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

288
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,115
...Armadillo...

289
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,655
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

290
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,986
...the universe will implode!

291
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,962
Merry Christmas!

292
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:12,201
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

293
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,335
Fine, I give up. Santa...

294
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,100
Santa can stay!

295
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,035
Well, I'll stay...

296
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:25,809
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

297
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,186
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

298
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,549
...and learn about Hanukkah?

299
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,850
Okay, Santa.

300
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,387
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

301
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,687
All right, it's time...

302
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,196
...for the story of Hanukkah.

303
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,530
Years and years ago...

304
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,536
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

305
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,200
Merry Christmas!

306
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:04,513
Oh, wow, look at this place!

307
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,886
Oh, this is terrible.

308
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,527
They've made so many changes...

309
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:14,097
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

310
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,793
Oh, new sconces!

311
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,532
- Oh, my God!
- What?

312
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,800
Okay, remember how you told me
that your grandmother put up that wall...

313
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,237
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,743
And that the landlord
might find out...

315
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,074
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

316
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,217
Do you really not know
where I'm going with this?

317
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,112
No, of course I do. What?

318
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,583
It left. It's one huge room.

319
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,852
Oh, no!

320
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,025
Wow!

321
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,025
See?

322
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,904
I guess we'll just have to
put the wall back up.

323
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:57,405
- You can't, because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

324
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,911
Wow!

325
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,540
So, what should we do?
Should we start looking for a new place?

326
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,550
You know, I'm sensing...

327
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,689
...that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

328
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:15,687
Oh, yeah?

329
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:18,556
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

330
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,193
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

331
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:26,370
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

332
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:28,767
You heard it too? You have the gift.

333
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,567
Phoebe, it's okay.

334
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,736
I like living with Joey.

335
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,445
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

336
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,049
...it's closer to work.

337
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,219
And we do have fun.

338
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,913
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

339
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,726
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

340
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:51,727
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

341
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,457
Listen. I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

342
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:58,362
She said that since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

343
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,734
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

344
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,571
No, I do not hear that.

345
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,014
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.

346
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:15,313
She didn't say "chair," she said "share." You
should share the one-bedroom apartment.

347
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:18,012
Oh, the purple chair.
No, yeah, I heard that.

348
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:24,186
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

349
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:28,230
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

350
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,368
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

351
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:34,505
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

352
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,641
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

353
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,065
My favorite part...

354
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:42,703
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

355
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,555
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

356
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,390
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?

357
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,430
Because Aunt Monica
was very, very good this year.

358
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,603
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

359
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,773
...the Hanukkah candles!

360
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,078
Hey.

361
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:23,546
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

362
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,958
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

363
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,631
I understand why Superman is here...

364
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:39,396
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

365
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:49,103
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

366
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,146
Is it back in the cage?

367
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,386
It's back in the cage.

368
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,414
Is the cage closed?

369
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:01,991
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!

370
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:18,365
