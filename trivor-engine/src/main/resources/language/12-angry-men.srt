1
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,500
I will kill you!

2
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,000
...and that concludes
the court's explanation

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,200
of the legal aspects of this case.

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
And now gentlemen of the jury I
come to my final instructions to you.

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,900
Murder in the first degree,

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,300
premeditated homicide is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

7
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
You've listened to the testimony,

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,900
you've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies to this case.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,500
It now becomes your duty to try to
separate the facts from the fancy.

10
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,100
One man is dead. The life
of another is at stake.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I urge you to deliberate
thoughtfully and honestly.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,000
If there is a reasonable doubt, you
must bring me a verdict of not guilty.

13
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,600
If however there is no reasonable
doubt, you must, in good conscience,

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,200
find the accused guilty.

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,400
Whatever your decision, your
verdict must be unanimous.

16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
In the event that you do
find the accused guilty,

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,900
Bear in mind that he could
face the death penalty.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,300
I don't envy your job, you're faced with a
grave responsibility gentlemen, thank you.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,400
Can I get a couple of you gentlemen to help
me pull those two tables together please?

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,800
Hey, get some windows open man.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah!

23
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,000
- Piece of gum?
- No, thank you.

24
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,000
- Bad news.
- What?

25
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
You see the Weather Report?

26
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the hottest day of the year.

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Figures...

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,900
You'd think they could have
air-conditioned the place, you know?

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,100
- I don't wanna drop dead in
court... Piece of gum? - Yeah!

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,600
You want anything, I’ll
be right outside the door.

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,700
Just hit the button
'n' I'll come right in.

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Thanks.

34
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I never knew they locked the door.

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,200
They always lock the door
brother. What'd you think?

36
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,200
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,800
- Hey, what's that for?
- I figured we might wanna vote by ballot.

38
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,200
That's a great idea. We might be
able to get this boy elected senator.

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,000
- Well, how'd you like it?
- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,900
- Yeah? I'm falling asleep. - What I
mean is, I've never sat on a jury before.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
I've sat on juries.

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
One thing that always amazes
me is how these lawyers

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,800
can talk and talk, even on a
case as obvious as this one.

44
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,300
- I've never heard so much talk about
nothin'. - Well, I guess they're entitled.

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh sure, everyone's
entitled to a fair trial,

46
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,500
I'd be the last one to say
a thing against that, but...

47
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,000
sometimes I think, we ought
to take these tough kids

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and just slap 'em down,
before they start trouble.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,400
It would save a lot of time and money.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,800
Mr. Foreman, would d'ya
say, we get started here?

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,100
Yeah, let get this over with,
we probably all got things to do.

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,600
We might as well take a five minute
break. There's a man in the bathroom.

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,700
Are... we sitting in our own way?

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So what do you think about the case?

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I enjoyed it. No dead's
bus, you know what I mean?

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,200
We were lucky to get a murder case.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
I figured us for an assault or a
burglary or something like that.

58
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,600
These can be dull...

59
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, can you imagine, sitting in
here for three days just for this?

60
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah, how about that
business with the knife?

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,300
I mean, expecting normal people
to believe that kind of bullshit.

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Well you gotta expect that. You
know what you're dealing with here.

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
What's the matter? You cold?

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Well, I can hardly touch my
nose, you know what I mean?

65
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Your horn's alright. Try your lights.

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
Ahh, this is beautiful! The
air condition that doesn't work!

67
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,300
Somebody take a letter to
the mayor. Dear stingy...!

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
I didn't get a chance to see the
papers today. Anything new going on?

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,700
I was just wondering
how the market closed.

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,500
I wouldn't know.

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
You're in exchange or something?

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
No, no, I'm a broker.

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,700
Really? I run a messenger
service, The Beck and Call Company.

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,000
My wife's idea. We employ 37
people. Started from nothing!

75
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on, Mr. Foreman, come on,
what do you say, let's go here!

76
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright gentlemen, let's take seats.

77
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,000
This better be fast, I got two
tickets to the ball game tonight.

78
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,400
Yanks and Cleveland. We've got
this new kid Modjelewski in there.

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
This kid, he's a real
bull, you know, I mean...

80
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,300
Talking about a real
jug-handled. You know?

81
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,700
You quite the baseball fan, eh?

82
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Where do you want us to sit?

83
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,800
Well, I was thinking we'd just sit
in order of jury number: 2,3,4...

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I kinda like it.

85
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,700
If that's alright with you gentlemen.

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
- Sure!
- What's the difference?

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,500
I think it's reasonable to
sit according to numbers.

88
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

89
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,600
I beg your pardon?

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,100
I thought it was very
sharp the way he handled

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,600
all his points one by
one, in logical sequence.

92
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Takes a good brain for
that, I was very impressed.

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
Yes, he did an expert job.

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,100
They got a lot of drive these
guys, you know, real drive.

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's get this show on the road!

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,900
You... you'd like to sit down?

97
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Gentleman at the window?

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,500
Would you like to sit down?

99
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh... yeah, sorry!

100
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,200
It's pretty tough, isn't it?

101
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, the kid just kills his
father, bang... just like that!

102
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,600
If you analyze the figures on the...

103
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,400
Come on now, what figures?

104
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,200
It's those people I'm telling you.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
See, they just let the
kids run wild out there.

106
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,200
Maybe it serves 'em right,
you know what I mean?

107
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Where's that elderly gentleman?

108
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,400
He's in the bathroom.

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,200
Would you knock on the door please?

110
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Sure.

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Thank you.

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,800
You a Yankee fan?

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,400
No, Milwaukee.

114
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
Milwaukee? What, you kidding?

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,500
It's like getting hit on the
head with a crowbar once a day!

116
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I mean, tell me, who they got?

117
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,600
Really, I'm asking you, who they
got? Besides great grasskeepers?

118
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
We'd like to get started here.

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

120
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Quite alright.

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Alright gentlemen.

123
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
You can handle this
any way you'd like to.

124
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,800
I have no rules.

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
We can discuss it first and
then vote, that's one way

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
or we can vote and
then see where we stand.

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
That's all I have to say...

128
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

129
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Yeah, come on, let's vote!

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Then we can all go home!

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,100
It's up to you, but let's just remember
this is a first degree murder charge.

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,100
If we find him guilty, he
could die by lethal injection.

133
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
Yeah, let's vote.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Yeah, let's see who's where!

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Anyone who doesn't wanna vote?

136
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,200
Let's just remember
that this is gotta be

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
twelve to nothing either
way, that's the law.

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,700
Everyone ready?

139
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,300
All those voting
guilty raise your hands.

140
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Eleven.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,500
All those voting not guilty.

142
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,700
One.

143
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Eleven-one guilty.

144
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Now we now where we stand.

145
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Well there's always one, eh?

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
So what do we do now?

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,600
I guess we... talk.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Honestly, you really
think he's innocent?

149
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,900
I don't know.

150
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,400
I mean, let's be reasonable here.

151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,200
You sat in the court
room, you heard everything.

152
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,700
The rest of us did. This man is a
dangerous killer, you could see it.

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,600
Man? He's 18 years old.

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
He's old enough!

155
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,700
He knifed his own father,
four inches into the chest.

156
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,600
Pretty obvious. I was
convinced on the very first day.

157
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,600
Sure, who wasn't?

158
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I really think this is one
of these open and shut things.

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,300
I mean, they proved it
a dozen different ways.

160
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,500
Would you like to list 'em for you?

161
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,200
No, no, no...

162
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Then what DO you want?

163
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
I just wanna talk!

164
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Well, what's there to talk about?

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Eleven men here agree.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, who would have to
think twice about it except you?

167
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
Hey look, let me ask you a question.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Do you really believe that boy's story?

169
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,400
I don't know if I believe his
story or not, maybe I don't.

170
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
So then, why did you
vote not guilty for?

171
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Look, eleven men voted guilty.

172
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,000
I just don't find it easy to raise my
hand and send a boy to prison for life

173
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,700
or maybe even to be executed
without talking about it first.

174
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,400
- Who says it's easy for me?
- No one.

175
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
What, because I voted fast?

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,700
No.

177
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,100
I honestly think the kid's guilty.

178
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked a 100 years!

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not trying to change your mind.

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,300
We're talking about
a person's life here.

181
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,800
We can't just decide in 5 minutes.

182
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,900
Suppose we're wrong?

183
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,300
Suppose we're wrong! Suppose the
whole building fell on my head!

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,700
You could suppose anything you want.

185
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
That's right.

186
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,600
So then what difference does
it make how long it takes?

187
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,200
If we honestly think the kid's guilty,
suppose we finish in 5 minutes, so what?

188
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Suppose we take an hour, your
game doesn't start till 8 o'clock.

189
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Ok slugger, be my guest.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Who's got something to say?

191
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,700
Not me.

192
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm willing to put in an hour.

193
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,700
- What? - Great! I heard a
pretty good story last night...

194
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
There is this woman, she goes
running into the doctor's office...

195
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Excuse me, that's not why
we are sitting in here for.

196
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,300
Alright then, you tell me
what are we sitting here for.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,900
Well, maybe for no reason,
I don't know, but look...

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,600
...this kid has been knocked
around all of his life,

199
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,000
been born in a slum, he lost his
mother when he was just, what, 9...

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
and he spent a year and
a half in an orphanage,

201
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,900
while his old man was doing
a jail term for forgery.

202
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
That's not a very good headstart.

203
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,300
He's had a rotten 18 years.

204
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,800
I just think we owe that
boy a few words, that's all.

205
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
Hey look, I don't mind
telling you this mister,

206
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
but we don't owe him a thing!

207
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,300
That's right!

208
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I mean, he had a fair trial, didn't he?

209
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
What do you think that trial cost?

210
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,000
And he was lucky he got it.

211
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
We're all grown ups in here and
we heard the facts, now didn't we?

212
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Now you're not gonna sit there 'n' tell
us we're supposed to believe this kid

213
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
knowing what he is.

214
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Look, I've lived among them all my life.

215
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,300
I mean, you can't believe a word
they say. They are born liars.

216
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,800
It suddenly occurs to me that
you must be an ignorant man.

217
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
What are you talking about?

218
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,800
You think you have a
monopoly on the truth?

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,900
Why are you making a federal case out of
this, come on man, how do you like this guy?

220
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,500
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

221
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
This isn't Sunday, we
don't need a sermon in here.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
I don't see any need to argue like that,

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
I think we ought to be able
to behave like gentlemen,

224
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,400
if we're going to discuss this case.

225
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,300
Maybe the gentleman who's disagreeing
down there could tell us why.

226
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,100
Tell us what he thinks and we could
show him where he's probably mixed up.

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,800
- What are you doing?
- Eh?

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What is that?

229
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
It's one of the products I work
on at the ad agency: Rice Pops.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,500
"The breakfast with the built
in bounce" I wrote that one.

231
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,900
Oh, that's where that came from.

232
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,200
That's very catchy.

233
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Do you mind?

234
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,900
I'm sorry, I just have this habit
of doodling. It keeps me focused.

235
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,700
We're trying to do something.
We could be sitting here forever.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,700
No, look, look, look,
I might have an idea.

237
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,400
I mean I'm just thinking
out loud, but it seems to me

238
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
that it's up to us to convince this
gentleman that we're right and he's wrong.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Maybe if we each took a minute or two
to explain how we feel, you know...

240
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,000
- It was just a quick thought.
- No, no, no, that's good.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Suppose we go once around the table.

242
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
- Anything, just let start it off!
- Fine, why don't you go first?

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
No, not me...

244
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,700
I think we ought to go in order.

245
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,200
Ok, that's fair... in
order. Two minutes a piece.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,700
That means you go first.

247
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
Oh, well, um...

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, it's hard to put it into
words... I just think that he's guilty.

249
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,500
I thought it was obvious from the
word go. Nobody proved otherwise.

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,900
Nobody has to prove otherwise. The burden
of proof rests with the prosecution.

251
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,600
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,300
I know that! What I meant was...

253
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,100
The man is guilty,
there was a witness.

254
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Somebody saw him do it.

255
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,500
Ok, here's what I think.

256
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,000
And I have no personal feelings
at all, I'm talking facts.

257
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,100
Number one, let's take
the old man who lived

258
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,800
on the 2nd floor directly
underneath the room

259
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,600
where the murder was committed.

260
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,400
Now, he says that about 10 minutes
after 12 on the night of the killing

261
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,300
he heard a loud noise from
upstairs. Sounded like a fight.

262
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,100
And he heard the boy yell
out: "I'm going to kill you"

263
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,300
A second later the body hit the floor,
he run to his apartment door, looked out,

264
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,600
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

265
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,400
He called the police and they found
the father with a knife in his chest.

266
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,600
- And the coroner fixed the
time of death around midnight.

267
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,800
He's right. These are facts. You
can't refute facts. This kid's guilty.

268
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,000
Look, I'm as sentimental as the
next guy. I know he's only 18.

269
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
But he's gotta pay for what he did.

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm with you pops.

271
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,600
It was obvious to me that the
boy's entire story was flimsy.

272
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,000
He claimed he was at the movies
at the time of the killing

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,200
yet one hour later he couldn't
remember what films he saw.

274
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,800
- He claims that.
- That's right. Did you hear that?

275
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
That's absolutely right.

276
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,000
And no one saw him going
into or out of the theater.

277
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
And what about the
woman across the street?

278
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,500
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

279
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
That's right, she's the one
who actually saw the killing.

280
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,100
That's right.

281
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Come on fellas, let's go
in order here, come on.

282
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Now look. Here's a woman
who's lying in her bed.

283
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,100
She can't sleep, dying from
the heat, you know what I mean.

284
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,900
And then she looks out the
window, and right across the street

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,600
she sees this kid stick
the knife into his father.

286
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
It's 12.10 on the nose. Everything fits.

287
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
And look, she's known
this boy all of his life.

288
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
His window is right
opposite hers right across

289
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
the el tracks and she
swore she saw him do it.

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,900
Through the windows of
a passing elevated train?

291
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
This el train had no passengers on.
It was just being moved downtown.

292
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
Lights out, remember that?

293
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,000
And they proved in court
that at night you can

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,800
look through the windows
of a passing el train

295
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,300
with the lights out and you can see
what's happening on the other side.

296
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Now they proved that!

297
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,500
Could I ask you a question?

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,900
Go ahead.

299
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,900
You don't believe the boy.
Why do you believe the woman?

300
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,300
Isn't she one of them too?

301
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,400
Oh you're just a real
smart fellow, aren't you?

302
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Take it easy.

303
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
What's he so wise
about? I'm telling ya...

304
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,000
Alright, alright, we don't
need none of that in here.

305
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,000
Now, whose turn is it?

306
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,200
Alright, you're next.

307
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
I pass.

308
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,300
- What did he say?
- He passes.

309
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,400
It's his privilege.

310
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,200
How about the next gentleman?

311
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,300
I don't know...

312
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,800
I came convinced very early
in the case. Excuse me.

313
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,500
See, I'm looking for motive.

314
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,700
I think it's very important. If you don't
have a motive you don't have a case, right?

315
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,000
So anyway, that testimony from those people
across the hall from the kid's apartment,

316
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,400
well, that's why that was so important,

317
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
cause didn't they say that the
father 'n' the kid had an argument

318
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,300
and the kid run out
sometime around 7 o'clock

319
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,800
that night, I could be
wrong about the time...

320
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
It was 8 o'clock.

321
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes, that's right, it was 8 o'clock.

322
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,300
They heard the argument but they
couldn't tell what the argument was about.

323
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Then they heard the
father hit the son twice

324
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,800
and then later they saw the son
walk out of the apartment angrily

325
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,300
...but what does it prove?

326
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,300
It don't exactly prove anything, I'm just
saying it's part of the picture, that's all.

327
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,900
Yeah, but you did say it revealed the
motive and that's what the prosecution said.

328
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,900
To me it's a very weak motive!

329
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,600
This boy has been hit so many times that
violence is a normal part of his life.

330
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't think a couple more hits in
the face would provoke him to murder.

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
It may have been two hits too
many. Everyone has a breaking point.

332
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,400
- Anything else?
- No.

333
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,600
- How about the next gentleman?
- Me?

334
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
I don't know...

335
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,400
I mean it's practically all
been said already, you know?

336
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I mean we could talk about it forever.

337
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,300
This kid's 0 for five. I
mean look at his record.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,300
At 10 he's at juvenile court,
he threw a rock at a teacher,

339
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,100
at 14 he was in reform
school cause he stole a car,

340
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
he's been arrested for muggin',

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,100
he's been picked up twice for trying
to slash another teen with a knife,

342
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,300
he's real good with that switchblade
you know. Everybody said that.

343
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,900
This is a real fine boy.

344
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,300
Ever since he was 5 years
old, his father beat him up

345
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
and he used his fists.

346
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,000
So would I. A kid like that?

347
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Wouldn't you call those beatings a
motive for him to kill his father?

348
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
I'd say it's a motive for him to
be an angry young man, I'd say that.

349
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
These kids, the way they are nowadays.

350
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
They're angry, hostile.

351
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,600
I mean, look at the way they talk.

352
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,100
When I was at his age I called
my father "Sir", that's right!

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,700
Ever hear a boy call
his father that anymore?

354
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Fathers don't seem to think
that's important anymore.

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,300
- No? You got any kid?
- Two.

356
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,700
I got one.

357
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,200
He is 32.

358
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
We did everything in the world
for that boy that could happen.

359
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,400
When he was 9 he run away from a fight,

360
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,400
I saw him do it, I was so
ashamed I almost threw up.

361
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
And I said to him right straight out,
I said "I'm gonna make a man out of you

362
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,600
or I'm gonna bust you in half trying".

363
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,900
I made a man out of him alright.

364
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,900
When he was 16 we got into a battle,
he hit me in the face, big kid, ya know.

365
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,300
I haven't seen him in 14 years.

366
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,900
Rotten kid!

367
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,800
You work your heart out...

368
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,200
Well come on, let's get on with it.

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,900
I think... I think we're
missing the point here.

370
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,300
This boy, let's say he's a
product of a filthy neighborhood

371
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,200
and a broken home, he can't help it,

372
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,900
we're here to decide whether
he's guilty or innocent of murder,

373
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,500
not to go into reasons
why he grew up this way.

374
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
He was born in a slum.

375
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals,
I know as a view it's no secret.

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,200
Slum big grounds are
potential menaces to society.

377
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,600
You can say that again!

378
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,900
Alright, kids who crawl out of these
places they're nothing but trash.

379
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,500
Hey, I don't want a think in the
world to do with them, I'm telling you.

380
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,200
I lived in a slum all my life!

381
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,800
I nursed that trash in Harlem
hospital six nights a week.

382
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,600
Hey, now, come on!

383
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
I used to play in a backyard that was full
of garbage, maybe it still smells on me!

384
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Now, come on, why you got to go there...

385
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,100
- Let's be reasonable, there's nothing
personal... - There is something personal!

386
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,800
Now, now, let's not be so sensitive.

387
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,100
This kind of sensitivity I understand.

388
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,200
Alright, let's stop all this
arguing, it's just wasting time.

389
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
Now, it's your turn, let's go.

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Me? I didn't expect a turn.

391
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,800
I thought everybody was trying to
convince me, I thought that was the idea.

392
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,500
Check, I forgot about that.

393
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,400
I mean, what's the difference?
He's the one keeping us here,

394
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
let's see what he's got to say.

395
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,400
Wait a minute! We decided we're
gonna do this a certain way,

396
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
let's stick to what we said.

397
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
Come on, stop treating us like kids!

398
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,500
- Kids? What are you talking about?
- Just what I said.

399
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,200
What, just that I'm trying
to keep things organized here?

400
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Listen, you wanna do this? You sit here!

401
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,100
You take responsibility.
I'll just shut up.

402
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,300
What now, why'd get so hot about it man,
why don't you just calm down up there!

403
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,200
Don't tell me to calm
down, here's the chair.

404
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,100
You keep things runnin'
smooth 'n' everything.

405
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,300
You think it's a snap?
Come on man Mr. Foreman,

406
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,100
let's see how great you run this show.

407
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,000
- You ever seen a thing like that before?
- Oh you think it's funny now, eh?

408
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,700
Hey, this whole thing is unimportant.

409
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,900
It's unimportant?
What? You wanna try it?

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
No, look, you're doing a beautiful job!

411
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
You're doing a beautiful job!

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Come on now, let's hear from somebody.

413
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Excuse me gentlemen!

414
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
If you would like to hear
how I feel about all of this,

415
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
I'd be glad to tell you right now.

416
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,900
I don't care what you gonna do!

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,400
Oh now, he's mad, you mad?

418
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't have anything brilliant and
I already know what you all know.

419
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,900
From the testimony,
the boy looks guilty.

420
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,800
- You can say that again!
- Alright, now maybe he is, but,

421
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,200
I spent 3 days in court listening to
that evidence build up and build up

422
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:49,400
and everyone seemed so positive, I began
to get a peculiar feeling about this case,

423
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,600
because nothing is
that positive, nothing.

424
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,500
I had a bunch of questions
I wanted to ask about all

425
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,700
these things, they mean
anything or not I don't know,

426
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,800
but I do know that I felt the lawyer,
the boy's lawyer, was not doing his job.

427
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,300
He was letting too many
things go by, little things

428
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,500
What do you mean little things? Look,
when these guys don't ask questions,

429
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,400
it's because they know the answer and they
figure that they'll probably get hurt by it.

430
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,200
Yeah, but it could also mean that the
lawyer is just plain stupid, couldn't it?

431
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,900
Sounds like you've
met my brother in law.

432
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Anyway... I put myself
in the boy's place.

433
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,500
If I was that boy, I would've
asked for another lawyer.

434
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,500
I mean, if I'm on trial for my life

435
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,800
I would want my lawyer to
take all of the prosecution's

436
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,200
witnesses and just tear
them to shreds, or try.

437
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,900
Now look, there was one
eye witness to this killing

438
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
and someone else said
that they heard it and then

439
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,100
saw the boy running out later.

440
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,500
There was a lot of
circumstantial evidence,

441
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,700
but those two witnesses where the
entire case for the prosecution.

442
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,400
Suppose they were wrong!

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,100
What do you mean suppose they were wrong?
What's the point of having witnesses at all?

444
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,200
Could they be wrong?

445
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,600
They took the stand under oath!
What are you trying to say?

446
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Well, they're people.
People make mistakes.

447
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,600
Could they be wrong?

448
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
No, I don't think so.

449
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Do you know so?

450
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,700
Nobody could know something like
that. This isn't an exact science.

451
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,100
That's right, it isn't.

452
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Let's try to get to the point.

453
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Let's take the knife they
found on the father's chest.

454
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,600
Wait a minute! Don't
you think we ought to...

455
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,700
Some of the people haven't
had the chance to talk.

456
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,700
They can talk anytime they want,
just gimme a second here, will you?

457
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
What about that knife?

458
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,800
You know the one our fine, upright boy
admitted buying the night of the murder?

459
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,700
Let's talk about it.

460
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Yes, let's talk about it.

461
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,300
As a matter of fact let's look at it
again. I'd like to see it. Mr. Foreman?

462
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,300
We all know what it looks like. What
are we gonna gain by seeing it again?

463
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,500
He brought it up.

464
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits of evidence,

465
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,700
the knife, where it was bought, it's
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

466
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Yes I do.

467
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,100
- We're gonna need that knife.
- OK.

468
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,700
One: The boy admitted
going out of his house

469
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
at 8 o'clock on the night of the murder

470
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,000
after being punished
several times by his father.

471
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,500
He said slapped, not punished. There's
a difference between a slap and a punish.

472
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,900
After being slapped
several times by his father.

473
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,100
Two: The boy went directly
to a neighbourhood junkshop,

474
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,200
where he bought,
what do you call it?

475
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,600
- Switchblade!
- Switchblade knife!

476
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Thank you, thank you. Three: This
wasn't what you'd call an ordinary knife.

477
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,100
It had a very unusual carved handle.

478
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,900
Four: The storekeeper who sold it to him
identified the knife in court and said

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,800
it was the only one of its kind
that he had ever had in stock.

480
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,300
Five: At about 8:45 the boy run into
three friends of his in front of a diner.

481
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
Am I correct so far?

482
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,300
You bet he is! Listen to this man,
he knows what he's talking about.

483
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,700
The boy talked with his friends for
about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

484
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,300
During this time, they
saw the switch blade knife.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,900
Six: Each of them identified the death
weapon in court as that same knife.

486
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Seven: The boy arrived
home at about 10 o'clock.

487
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Now, this is where the
stories offered by the

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,700
boy and the state begin
to diverge slightly.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,500
He claims that he stayed home until 11:30
then went to one of those all-night movies,

490
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,000
he returned home at about 3:50 in
the morning to find his father dead

491
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
and himself arrested.

492
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,300
Now, what happened to
the switchblade knife?

493
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,100
He claims that the knife fell
through a hole in his pocket,

494
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,700
sometime between 11:30 and 3:50 while
he was on the street to the movie

495
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,500
and that he never saw it again.

496
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,400
No! This is a tale gentlemen!

497
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,200
I think it's quite clear that he
never went to the movies that night.

498
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,300
No one in the house saw him go out at
11:30. No one at the theatre identified him.

499
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

500
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,100
Now... what actually happened is this.

501
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,000
The boy stayed home, had
another fight with his father,

502
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,600
stabbed him to death with the
knife at about 10 minutes after 12

503
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,100
and fled from the house.

504
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,100
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

505
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Thanks man.

506
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
Please give me the knife.

507
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,300
Are you trying to tell me that the knife
fells through a hole in the boy's pocket,

508
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,000
that someone picked it up off the
street where it was the boy's house,

509
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,100
stabbed his father, just to be amusing?

510
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm just saying that it is
possible that the boy lost the knife

511
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,000
and somebody else stabbed his
father with a similar knife.

512
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,700
It's possible, that's all.

513
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
It's possible...

514
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,700
Take a look at that knife.

515
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,600
I've never seen one like it.

516
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,800
Neither has the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

517
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,600
And you're asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

518
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm not asking you to accept anything.
I'm just saying that it's possible.

519
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,200
And I say it's not possible!

520
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,100
What are you trying to do?

521
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Who do you think you are...

522
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,700
Hey, what is this? Where
did you get that knife now?

523
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,300
Where has that come from?

524
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Quiet, quiet, please!

525
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Where did you get that knife?

526
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,000
I was out walking last
night, just... thinking...

527
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
I was in the boy's neighborhood,

528
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,500
that knife comes from a pawn
shop three blocks from his house,

529
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,100
it cost 25$.

530
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,900
- It's against the law to buy it.
- I broke the law.

531
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Listen, you pulled a
pretty bright trick here,

532
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,900
now suppose you tell me what it proves.

533
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,900
There could be ten
knives like that, so what?

534
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
There could be...

535
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
What does that mean?

536
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I mean, so he got the
same kind of knife,

537
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,100
what is that, the discovery
of the age or something?

538
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
It'd still be an incredible
coincidence for another person

539
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,800
to have stabbed the father
with the same kind of knife.

540
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,700
Come on, the odds are a million to one!

541
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,100
But it's possible!

542
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Alright gentlemen, let's take sits.
There's no point meddling around here.

543
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,900
Very interesting that he should find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

544
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,500
What's interesting about
it? It proves anything?

545
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,600
Proves? No, no, no... I didn't mean...

546
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,700
How come the kid bought the
knife in the first place?

547
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Well, he claims...

548
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
I know he claims he bought it
as a present for a friend of his,

549
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,600
who was gonna give it
to him the next day,

550
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,300
because he busted the other kid's
knife dropping it off the pants!

551
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,500
That's what he said.

552
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,600
The friend testified in court
that the boy did break his knife.

553
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,500
How long before the killing?

554
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Three weeks, right?

555
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,800
So how come our noble lad bought this thing
an half an hour after his father smacked him

556
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,900
and three and a half
hours before they found it

557
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,600
shoved up to here into
the father's chest?

558
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,700
Look, he was gonna give it to his
friend, he just wanted to use it first.

559
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,800
Let me ask you a question, this is
something I wanted to bring up in court.

560
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If the boy did buy the knife to use
on his father, how come he showed

561
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
what was going to
become the murder weapon

562
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,000
to three friends a couple
of hours before the killing?

563
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,800
All this is just talk!

564
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,700
The boy lied and you know it.

565
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,400
Do you think he lied?

566
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
That's a stupid question,
damn right he lied!

567
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
And you sir?

568
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,300
You don't have to ask me that,
you know my answer, he lied, yes!

569
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,900
And you?

570
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,500
- I think maybe...
- Maybe, wait a second!

571
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
What are you, the kid's
lawyer or something?

572
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Who are you to come in here
and start cross examining us?

573
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,100
Isn't this what's supposed
to happen in a jury room?

574
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,100
There are still eleven of us
in here who think he's guilty.

575
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,500
Yeah, I mean what'd you
think you gonna accomplish?

576
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,300
You're not gonna change anybody's mind!

577
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
You wanna be stubborn and
hang this jury? Go ahead!

578
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,400
The kid'll be tried again and
found guilty, as sure as he's born.

579
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
You're probably right!

580
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,600
So then what do you wanna do about
it? We could be here all night...

581
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's only one night. A boy may die.

582
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,900
Oh brother!

583
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,800
Anybody got a deck o'cards?

584
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,300
I don't think he should joke about it.

585
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
I don't see how all this talk about
the knife's got to do with anything.

586
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,900
I mean, come on, somebody
saw that boy stab his father.

587
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,100
What more do we need?

588
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,700
I got three car washes out there going to
pot while we're sitting up in here talking.

589
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,000
Come on, let's get done with
this so we can get outta here!

590
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,700
Excuse me, but...

591
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,600
...the knife was very important
to the district attorney,

592
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,300
he took one whole morning with that!

593
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,900
Come on, that guy was a 15th assistant
or something... What does he know?

594
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,700
I think we should get on with it.

595
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,700
These side arguments only slow us up.

596
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Now, what about it?

597
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,900
You are the only one...

598
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,500
Gentlemen...

599
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,900
I have a proposition.

600
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,700
I'd like to call for another vote,

601
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,900
I want you eleven men to
vote by secret written ballot

602
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,200
and I will abstain.

603
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,200
If all eleven of you vote guilty,

604
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm not gonna hold out, we'll go in
with a verdict to the judge right now.

605
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,200
But if anyone votes not
guilty, then we stay and talk!

606
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,300
And... that's all...

607
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,700
I'm ready right now,
if you'll all go for it.

608
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Finally, you're behaving
like a reasonable man!

609
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,100
Come on, let's do it!

610
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
Anyone who doesn't agree?

611
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
Alright, pass these along.

612
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Come on, today man...

613
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Alright...

614
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Guilty.

615
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Guilty.

616
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Guilty.

617
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Guilty.

618
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Guilty.

619
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Guilty.

620
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Guilty.

621
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Guilty.

622
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Guilty.

623
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,200
Not guilty.

624
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Guilty.

625
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,800
Well how do ya like that?

626
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
And another chap flips
his god damn wings!

627
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,300
Come on who was it? Cause I wanna know!

628
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,100
Excuse me! We agreed that
this would be a secret ballot.

629
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,300
- Secret?
- Yeah!

630
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,300
- What are you talking about?
- Secret...

631
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,400
There's no secrets in the jury room...

632
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,400
I know who did it...

633
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,100
Brother you are really
something, you know that?

634
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
You come in here

635
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,500
and you vote guilty like everybody else

636
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,700
and then there's golden voice preacher
over here starts to tear your heart out

637
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
with a lot of stories
about a poor little boy

638
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,900
who just couldn't help
becoming a murderer.

639
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,600
So you change your vote...

640
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,000
...that is the most sickening...

641
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

642
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,700
Wait a minute, you can't talk like that!

643
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,600
Sit down!

644
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,300
- He's very excitable.
- Damn right I'm excitable!

645
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
We're trying to put a
guilty man where he belongs

646
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
and somebody's telling us fairy tales

647
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
and we're listening!

648
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,200
- Take it easy.
- What do you mean take it easy?

649
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,300
You feel like seeing a proven
murderer walking the streets?

650
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,500
I'll tell you what! Let's give him
his knife back, make it easier for him!

651
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,900
Alright, stop the yelling!

652
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,500
Now does anyone have
any other suggestions?

653
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,500
Excuse me, I would
like to say something.

654
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,600
I've always thought that
in this country a man was

655
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,400
entitled to have an unpopular opinion.

656
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Hey look, let's stick
to the subject, ok pal?

657
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,900
Why did you switch your vote for?

658
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Now look... ain't none of
your fucking business...

659
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
He didn't switch his vote, I did.

660
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,500
Would you like me to tell you why?

661
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
No, I wouldn't like
you to tell me why...

662
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, I'd like to make
myself clear anyway...

663
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,800
If you don't mind.

664
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Do we have to listen to this?

665
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,700
Hey look, the man wants to talk!

666
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you!

667
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,400
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

668
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,100
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

669
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,200
He just isn't sure.

670
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,300
Well it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others...

671
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,100
He gambled for support
and I gave it to him.

672
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
I respect his motives.

673
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,800
The boy on trial is probably guilty.

674
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,600
But I wanna hear more...

675
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,900
I'm talking here!

676
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,000
You have no right to just walk...

677
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,300
He can't hear you. He never will.

678
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Sit down.

679
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,900
If the speech is over, may we go on?

680
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,600
I think we ought to take a break,
there is a man inside there...

681
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,700
...we should wait for him.

682
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,500
Look I... was pretty excited,
you know what I mean...

683
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
I didn't mean to get nasty or anything.

684
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Thank you.

685
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,600
God, I wish I knew some
way we could break this up.

686
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,000
You know in advertising... I told
you I work in an ad agency, didn't I?

687
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,600
Well, we got some pretty
strange people down there.

688
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,900
Well, not strange really,
they just have peculiar ways

689
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
of expressing themselves
sometimes, you know what I mean.

690
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,300
It's probably the same
thing in your business.

691
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,700
What is it you do?

692
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm a watch maker.

693
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Really?

694
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Finest watchmakers in the world
come from Europe, don't they?

695
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,600
Anyway! Like I was saying...

696
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,200
At the ad agency, when we reach
a point like this in a meeting,

697
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
there's always some character
ready with an idea that kills me.

698
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
I mean it's the weirdest thing
sometimes, the way they...

699
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,700
...percieve their idea with
some little phrase, you know,

700
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
like some count exec would go

701
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
"Oh here's an idea, let's
hang around the flag pole,

702
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,900
see if anyone sings the national anthem"

703
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,700
or... "Here's an idea, let's put it on
the bus, see if it gets of at Wall Street"

704
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,100
I mean, it's idiotic
really, but it's funny.

705
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,000
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

706
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,500
So, I wonder if I can
ask you a question.

707
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,700
Are you one of those nation Islam guys?

708
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,800
I only ask cause I've never
met one of you guys before.

709
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
I was...

710
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,900
But we didn't exactly see things
eye to eye, you know what I'm saying?

711
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,700
Not really...

712
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,100
But anyway, I was wondering
if you could do me a favour,

713
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,600
maybe take it a little
easier on the old man.

714
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,600
I figure once you get up that high in
years, you know, deserve a little break?

715
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,200
I guess that's a no.

716
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,800
- You a salesman?
- No, architect.

717
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,000
- You know what a soft sell is?
- Yes...

718
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,200
You're pretty good at it!

719
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
I've got a different
technique, you know?

720
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,200
- Jokes, drinks, knock'em on their asses.
- Yeah...

721
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,400
I made 57 thousand last
year. Selling marmalade.

722
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700
That's not bad. I mean, you
know, considerin' the marmalade.

723
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,900
So what are you getting out of this?

724
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,900
Kicks? The boy's guilty pal.

725
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Why don't you let us go home
before we all get sore throats?

726
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
What's the difference whether you
get one here or at the ball game.

727
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,800
...That's too... No difference
pal, no difference at all...

728
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,900
Nice bunch of guys!

729
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,800
- Same as any... I guess.
- Yeah.

730
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,100
- You know, that guy with the hat?
- Yeah.

731
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
He's a real prince!

732
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
And out loud every second
everyone stalks by this kid

733
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,700
...the way he's
talking... is embarassing.

734
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
Murderous day!

735
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Will we be much longer?

736
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
I don't know.

737
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He's guilty you know! Not
a doubt in the whole world.

738
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
Should have been done by now!

739
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,600
Not that I really care, I
mean, beats working... Right?

740
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,300
You think he's innocent?

741
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
I don't know.

742
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,500
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you've never been wronger in your life.

743
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
Better wrap it up.

744
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,000
Just waisting your time.

745
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,400
Suppose you were the one on trial.

746
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,200
Well... I don't do a lot of supposing...

747
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,400
You know, I'm just the working man.

748
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Let my boss do my supposing.

749
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,800
But if you want I'll try one.

750
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Suppose you talk us all out o' this

751
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,100
and that kid really did stick
that knife into his father.

752
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
Alright gentlemen, let's take our seats.

753
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,400
Looks like we'll be here for dinner.

754
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's get down to business.

755
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,900
Who wants to start it off?

756
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,100
- I'd like to say something...
- Be quiet...

757
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Excuse me!

758
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Number 6.

759
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,300
Alright, please go
ahead, go ahead, please...

760
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,800
This may be a small point, but anyway...

761
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
The boy had a motive for the killing.

762
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
The beatings 'n' all, right?

763
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,200
If he didn't do it, who did it?

764
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Who else had a motive?

765
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,800
I mean, that's my point.
You don't go out and just

766
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,300
kill somebody for no reason,
unless you're just plain nuts.

767
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
As far as I can see, we're here to
determine whether or not this boy

768
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,100
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

769
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,400
We're not concerned with anyone else's
motives, that's a job to the police.

770
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,400
Alright... but it can't
help letting the only

771
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,900
motive we know of
creep into our thoughts.

772
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,200
We can't help asking ourselves,
who else might have had a motive.

773
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,000
I mean, this gentleman is
asking a reasonable question:

774
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,100
Somebody killed him, if it
wasn't the boy, who was it?

775
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,900
Modjelewski!

776
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,300
Ohhh, you're talking
about the man I love!

777
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,200
Maybe if you haven't got anything to
add besides jokes, I suggest you listen.

778
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm sorry, I was just
letting off steam. Go ahead.

779
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,700
Maybe you can answer me, who
else might have killed the father?

780
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Well, I don't know... I mean...

781
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,000
The father was hardly a model citizen,

782
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
we knew that he served a prison term

783
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,800
and that he was an inveterate
gambler and a consistent loser

784
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,200
and he frequented all of the local bars.

785
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,700
Usually after a couple of drinks
he'd get into a fight over a woman

786
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,900
...I wouldn't mind telling that...

787
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,900
He was a mean, cruel,
primitive kind of man.

788
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,200
He couldn't even hold a job for longer
than 6 months in his entire life.

789
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,100
So, hell, he could have been murdered
by anyone of the prison inmates,

790
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,000
or a bookmaker, or somebody he
beat up, or a woman he picked up,

791
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,700
or anyone of those tough guys
that he used to hang around with.

792
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Look, come on man, we know
that the father was a bump,

793
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,100
what's that got to do with anything?

794
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,700
Well, I didn't bring this thing up, the
man asked who else might have killed the man

795
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,000
and I gave an answer.

796
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,600
That gentleman there
asked a direct question.

797
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,600
Well, everybody is a lawyer...

798
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
Suppose you answer this for me...

799
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,600
The old man downstairs heard the
kid yell loud: "I'm gonna kill you".

800
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,200
A split second later,
the body hit the floor,

801
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,900
then he saw the kid
running out of the house.

802
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,500
Now what does all that mean to you?

803
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,400
I was wondering how well you could hear
that boy's voice through the ceiling.

804
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,900
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.

805
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,300
His window was open. The
window was open upstairs,

806
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
it was a hot night, remember?

807
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
The voice was from another
appartment, it's very difficult

808
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,600
to identify a voice, let
alone a voice that's shouting.

809
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,000
He identified it in court.

810
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,700
He picked the boy's voice out
of 5 other voices blindfolded.

811
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,600
That was just an ambitious
district attorney putting on a show.

812
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,500
Look...

813
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,600
The old man knew the boy's voice very well.
They lived in the same house for years.

814
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,100
But to identify the voice
positively from another appartment...

815
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,100
Isn't it possible that he was wrong?

816
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,100
Isn't it possible that he
thought the boy was upstairs

817
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,700
and therefore he just assumed that
the voice he heard was the boy's voice?

818
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,700
I think that's a bit farfetched!

819
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,300
Look, the old man heard
the father's body falling.

820
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Then he saw the boy running out of the house
15 seconds later. Come on, he saw that boy.

821
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,500
What about the woman across the street?
She looked right out into the open window,

822
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,900
saw the kid stabbin' his father, I
mean, come on. Isn't that enough for you?

823
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,300
- Not right now it isn't.
- Oh man!

824
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,700
How do you like this guy, eh?

825
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,300
It's like talking to a dead phone!

826
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,800
The woman saw the kid through the
window of a moving elevated train.

827
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,400
The train had 6 cars and she saw it
through the windows of the last 2 cars.

828
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,700
I mean, she remembered the
most significant details.

829
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,700
I don't see how you can argue with that.

830
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
What do you got to say about that?

831
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,700
It doesn't seem right to me.

832
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,700
Well suppose you think about it, eh?

833
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,500
I wonder if there's anyone
here that has an idea

834
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,700
how long it would take a 6 car el train,

835
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,200
travelling at, what, medium speed...

836
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,400
Wait a minute!

837
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,800
This is not a game!

838
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,400
- Who do you think you are?
- Take it easy.

839
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Come on now, sit down!

840
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,800
That's all we need, a fighting here!

841
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,700
Did you see him? The
nerve, the absolute nerve!

842
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Who does he think
he's dealing with here?

843
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,000
Come on now, it's over.
Now let's just sit here...

844
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,300
It's not over, I want an apology!

845
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,900
Alright georgie, apologise, now let's
just hear what the man's got to say.

846
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
Thank you.

847
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
As I was trying to say, I wonder
if anybody here has an idea

848
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
how long it would take an el train

849
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,400
to pass a given point,
going at a medium speed.

850
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,000
What the hell does that
got to do with anything?

851
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,300
Well go on, just take a guess!

852
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,500
I wouldn't have the slightest idea.

853
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
You?

854
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,300
I don't know, 10, 12 seconds maybe...

855
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,800
- What's all this for? - Well that
sounds like a pretty good guess...

856
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,700
Anyone else?

857
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,900
That sounds right to me.

858
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,500
Come on, what are the
guessing games for?

859
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
You, how about you?

860
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,300
10 seconds, approximately.

861
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,100
Alright, say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

862
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Just this!

863
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,800
It takes 10 seconds for a six car
el train to pass a given point.

864
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,200
Let's say that given
point is the open window

865
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,000
of the room where the murder took place.

866
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,500
You can practically reach out that window
and touch the el tracks, couldn't you?

867
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

868
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,300
Let me ask you another
question gentlemen.

869
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,700
Is there anybody here who has
ever lived next to an el line?

870
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I just finished painting in an
appartment over next to an el line.

871
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,900
- Yeah?
- It took us three days.

872
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,100
- And what was it like?
- What do you mean?

873
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Noisy?

874
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,300
Yeah! Yeah, noisy! We were all punchy about
our business anyway, but yeah, it was noisy.

875
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,100
Yeah, well. When I was very young, I
had an apartment on the second floor

876
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,300
right next to an el line
and I wanna tell you,

877
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,000
when that window is open and the train
is roaring by, the noise is unbearable.

878
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,500
You can't hear yourself think!

879
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,500
OK, you can't hear yourself think,
now will you get to the point?

880
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,200
OK, let's try and tie two
pieces of evidence together.

881
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,700
No 1, the old man in
the apartment downstairs,

882
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,200
he swears that he heard the boy say

883
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,600
"I'm gonna kill you" and
then a split second later

884
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
what sounded like a body
falling to the floor.

885
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,700
- One second later, am I right?
- Right.

886
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,700
OK. Now the woman across the street,
she swears that she saw the stabbing

887
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,800
through the windows of
the last two cars of an

888
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,700
elevated train, the last
two cars, am I right?

889
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,900
What are you making here?

890
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,600
Alright, we agreed that it takes
10 seconds for an elevated train

891
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,900
to pass a given point.

892
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,700
If the woman witnessed the stabbing through
the last two cars, then we must assume

893
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,300
that the body fell just as
the train was passing by.

894
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,100
Therefore, it was
roaring by the old man's

895
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,000
window for a full 10
seconds before the body fell.

896
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,400
The old man, now, according
to his own testimony,

897
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,700
hearing the boy say
"I'm going to kill you"

898
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,700
and the body falling, must
have heard that statement

899
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,800
while the el was roaring
by right under his nose!

900
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,100
It's not possible that
he could've heard it.

901
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,700
It's idiotic! Sure he heard it!

902
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,300
You really think so, eh?

903
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,200
The old man said the boy yelled
it out, that's good enough for me.

904
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,800
Well, whatever he
heard, he couldn't have

905
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,700
identified the voice
with that el roaring by.

906
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,300
You're talking about a matter of seconds
here, nobody could be that accurate!

907
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,400
Well, I'll tell ya,
I think the testimony

908
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,400
that can send a human being to
death should be that accurate!

909
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,300
I don't think he could've heard it...

910
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
Yeah, maybe he didn't hear
it with all that el noise.

911
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,400
What are you people talking about?

912
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,100
- Well it stands to reason.
- It's crazy!

913
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,200
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

914
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Attention, maybe.

915
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,500
You keep coming up with
these bright sayings.

916
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Why don't you sell'em to the
Reader's Digest, they pay $50.

917
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,000
Why do you keep talking
to him like that, hah?

918
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,600
No, a guy who talks like that to an old man
ought to get stepped on, know what I mean?

919
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,100
You oughta have little respect!

920
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,900
You go ahead, you say whatever
you want! Noone's gonna stop you!

921
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,400
Why do you think the old man might lie?

922
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
Well,...

923
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,700
...it's just that I looked
at him for a very long time...

924
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,800
The seam of his jacket
was split under the arm.

925
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,100
Any of you notice it?

926
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,500
I mean, to come into court like that.

927
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,200
He was a very old man with a torn jacket

928
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,900
and he walked very
slowly towards the stand.

929
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,800
He was dragging his left
leg and trying to hide it,

930
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,100
because he was ashamed.

931
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,600
I think I know him
better than anyone here.

932
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,700
This is a quiet, frightened,

933
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,000
insignificant old man who's
been nothing, all his life.

934
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,500
Never had recognition, never
seen his name in the newspapers.

935
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,900
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

936
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

937
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,100
You know...

938
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,900
...that's a very sad
thing, to be a nothing.

939
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,300
A man like this needs to be recognised,

940
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,700
to be listened to, to be quoted,
just once. That's very important.

941
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,100
He would find it hard to
recede into the background,

942
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,100
when there's a chance
for him to become a...

943
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,900
Wait a minute, wait a
minute! Are you trying to tell

944
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,900
us that the guy would lie
just to be important once?

945
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
He wouldn't... really lie!

946
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,900
But perhaps he'd make
himself believe that

947
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,500
he heard those words and
recognised the boy's face.

948
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,400
That's the most fantastic
story I've heard in my life!

949
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,200
How can you just make
up some stuff like that?

950
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,200
What do you know about it?

951
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Sit down!

952
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,600
You sit down!

953
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,700
Sit down!

954
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,600
Gentlemen, let me remind
you, this case is based on

955
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,700
a reasonable and logical
progression of facts.

956
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,900
Please, let's keep it.

957
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,500
Facts may be covered by the personalities
of the people who present them.

958
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,300
Let's not forget that.

959
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,700
- Would anybody like a cough drop?
- Yeah, I would, thank you.

960
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,100
Say what you like fellas...

961
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,200
I still don't see how anybody
could think this kid's not guilty.

962
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,100
There's one thing I did wanna
talk about for just a minute.

963
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,500
I think that we have proven
that the old man could not

964
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,700
have heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you".

965
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,300
But suppose that...

966
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,200
What are you talking about, "prove"?

967
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,500
You haven't proved it at all!
What are you talking about?

968
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,900
But suppose he did hear it.

969
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I mean, how many times have we
all probably used that expression?

970
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,900
Hundreds of times, you know!

971
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
I could kill you for that darling, or...

972
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,900
...junior, I'm gonna kill you if
you do that one more time, or...

973
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,500
...kill'em Rocky, kill'em!

974
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,600
You know, it's just a common everyday...
It doesn't mean we're gonna kill someone.

975
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,400
Wait a minute, what are
you trying to give us here?

976
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,000
The phrase was "I'm going
to kill you" and the kid

977
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,900
screamed it out on the top of his lungs.

978
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,400
Don't tell me he didn't mean it!

979
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,500
Anybody who says something like
that, the way he said, they mean it.

980
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,200
Well, gee, I...

981
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,900
...I don't know...

982
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,200
I remember I was arguing with this
guy that I work next to at the bank,

983
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,800
so he called me an
idiot, so I was yelling...

984
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,900
This man is trying to get you to
believe things that just aren't so.

985
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,100
The boy said "I'm going to
kill you" and he did kill him!

986
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,700
Do you really think that he
would shout out something like

987
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,100
that for the whole neighbourhood
to hear? I don't think so.

988
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,500
I think he's too bright for that.

989
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Bright?

990
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,600
He's the common ignorant slob.

991
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,000
- He don't even speak good english.
- He does not even speak good english.

992
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,300
Mr. Foreman...

993
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,400
...I'd like to change
my vote to not guilty.

994
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,800
- Oh you got to be kidding me!
- You heard me.

995
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,100
Are you sure?

996
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Yes, I'm sure.

997
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
The vote is 9 to 3 in favour of guilty.

998
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,700
Well, if this isn't the livin' end!

999
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,500
What are you basing it on?

1000
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,500
The stories this guy made up?

1001
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,300
I mean, this guy... he should
write for Amazing Detective Monthly.

1002
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,600
He'd make a fortune!

1003
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,200
Now listen, Milwakee, there are facts
there and their right in your face.

1004
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,800
And everyone of them says
"This kid killed his old man"!

1005
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,000
I mean, his own lawyer, knew right from
the beginning he didn't stand a chance.

1006
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,300
His own lawyer!

1007
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,900
You could see it!

1008
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,200
- Body, he deserves to die!
- Oh, does he?

1009
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,200
For your information,
it's happened in the past

1010
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,200
that people had been convicted
of murder and then executed

1011
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,000
and later, years later, someone comes
along and confesses to the crime.

1012
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,600
You see, sometimes, the facts that
are staring us in the face are wrong...

1013
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,400
Hey listen, I'm talking
to him, not to you!

1014
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,900
Boy, this guy's beautiful, isn't he?

1015
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Yeah, listen, the kid
had a lawyer, didn't he?

1016
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,000
The lawyer presented the case, not you!

1017
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,200
- How come you got so much to say?
- The lawyer was court appointed!

1018
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,100
So what does that mean?

1019
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,200
It could mean a hell of a lot!

1020
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,900
It could mean he didn't want the case,

1021
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,500
it could mean he resented being
appointed, what's there for him?

1022
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,400
No hope, no glory, very
little chance of winning.

1023
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,900
Not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

1024
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,500
He would have to really believe in his
client in order to put up a good fight.

1025
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,200
As you mentioned a minute
ago, he obviously didn't!

1026
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Oh sure he didn't!

1027
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Who the hell could?

1028
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,400
Except maybe god come
to Earth or somebody...

1029
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,200
Come on guys, look at the time!

1030
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Pardon me here.

1031
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,900
- I have some notes here... somewhere...
- Notes?

1032
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,500
I... would... like...
to ask some questions.

1033
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,300
I've been listening very closely to
what this gentleman has been saying.

1034
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,000
He's got some very good points to make.

1035
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Now, from what was presented at the
trial, it seems that the boy is guilty,

1036
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,300
but maybe if we go deeper...

1037
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,900
Come on, will ya? Gee!

1038
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,200
I would like to ask one question.

1039
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,200
Now, we assumed that
the boy commited murder.

1040
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,300
That he stabbed his father in
the chest and then he run away.

1041
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,200
This was at 10 minutes after 12.

1042
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,100
Now, how was the boy caught...

1043
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
...by the police?

1044
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,500
He came back, at about 3 o'clock or so

1045
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,300
and he was caught by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

1046
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Come on man!

1047
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,900
Now my question is this...

1048
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,700
If he really did kill his father,
why did he come back 3 hours later?

1049
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,100
Would he not be afraid of
being caught by the police?

1050
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,600
Look, he came home to get his knife.

1051
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,700
It's not nice to leave knives
sticking around out of people's chests!

1052
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,300
Yes, especially relatives.

1053
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,000
- I don't see anything funny about it.
- Neither do I.

1054
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,400
The boy knew that there
were people who could

1055
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,800
identify the knife as the
one he had just bought.

1056
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,300
He had to get it before the police did.

1057
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
But if he knew that the
knife could be identified,

1058
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
why did he leave it in the first place?

1059
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,900
Oh well...

1060
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,600
I think we can assume he run out in a
state of panic after he killed his father.

1061
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,400
And when he finally calmed down, he
realised that he had left the knife there.

1062
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,600
Then this depends on
your definition of panic.

1063
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,600
Because he was calm enough

1064
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,900
to make sure that there were
no fingerprints on the knife.

1065
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,200
Now, where did his panic
start and where did it end?

1066
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,300
Look, you can throw all
that other staff out...

1067
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,000
He came home to dig out
his knife and get rid of it.

1068
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,200
- Three hours later?
- Sure, three hours later!

1069
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,500
If I had killed my father,
I would not be coming back

1070
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,300
three hours later, I would
be afraid of the police.

1071
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
No... I would stay
away, knife or no knife!

1072
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,500
Look, you voted guilty, didn't
you? What side are you on?

1073
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,000
I do not have to be loyal to one side or
the other, I'm simply asking questions.

1074
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,900
Well, look...

1075
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,900
This is just off the top of my
head but it seems to me, I mean,

1076
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,000
if I were the kid and I'd, you
know, done the stabbing and all that,

1077
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,100
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

1078
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,800
I mean, he probably
figured that noone's seen

1079
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,000
him and nobody didn't
discover the body yet.

1080
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I mean, it was the middle of the night.

1081
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,300
He probably figured that the body
wouldn't be found till the next day.

1082
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,200
Excuse me, but that is my whole point.

1083
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,600
Now...

1084
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,900
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing,

1085
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,400
that is a moment after
the el train went by,

1086
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,900
she screamed, then
telephoned the police.

1087
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,900
Now, the boy certainly must have heard
the scream and knew somebody saw something.

1088
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,900
No, I do not think the boy would have
gone back if he had been the murderer.

1089
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
Two points.

1090
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,200
One...

1091
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,200
In his state of panic, he
may not have heard the scream,

1092
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,400
perhaps it wasn't very loud.

1093
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,700
Two. If he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

1094
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,300
Remember, he lived in a neighbourhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

1095
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,500
Right! There's your answer.

1096
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,700
Maybe the boy did stab his
father, did not hear the screams,

1097
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,000
run off in a panic and
calmed down three hours later,

1098
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,300
came back to get his knife,
risking being caught by the police,

1099
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,100
maybe all of those things
are so and maybe not!

1100
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,300
I personally think there is
enough doubt for us to wonder

1101
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,100
if the boy was there at all
when the murder took place.

1102
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,900
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

1103
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,800
Didn't the old man see the
boy running out of the house?

1104
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,000
Well, see? He's twisting the facts!

1105
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,600
I'm telling you, he's twisting them!

1106
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,200
Did or didn't the old
man see the boy running

1107
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,400
out of the house at
12:10? Did he or didn't he?

1108
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
- He says he did...
- Well... "He say's he did"?

1109
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,300
How do you like this?
"He says he did"...

1110
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,900
Did or didn't the woman across the
street see the boy kill his father?

1111
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,200
She said she did!

1112
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,500
You make it like it don't
matter what people say.

1113
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,400
What you wanna believe, you believe, what
you don't wanna believe, so you don't!

1114
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,200
What kind of way is that?

1115
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,000
And what do you think these people
get up on the witness stand for?

1116
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Their health?

1117
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,800
I'm telling you man, the facts
are being changed in here.

1118
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,700
Witnesses are being doubted
and there's no reason for it!

1119
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,000
Witnesses can make mistakes.

1120
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,300
Yeah, when you want'em to
they do! You know what I mean?

1121
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Alright now, let's
keep the yelling down.

1122
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,400
Well you keep saying that!

1123
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,800
What we need in here
is a little yelling.

1124
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,500
These men running off every each way. Did
hear the scream, didn't hear the scream...

1125
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,000
What difference does it make?

1126
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,300
Those little details!

1127
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,900
You guys are missing
the important stuff.

1128
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,700
I mean, all of a sudden
you hear everybody...

1129
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,800
I would like to call for another vote.

1130
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,900
- I'm talking here! - Another vote called
for here, gentlemen take your sits.

1131
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,400
- What are we gonna gain by voting again?
- I don't know.

1132
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,900
The man asked for another vote,
we're gonna have another vote.

1133
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,700
I've never seen so much
time spent on nothing!

1134
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,200
It only takes a second...

1135
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,900
Alright, the fastest way is to
find out who's voting not guilty.

1136
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,700
All those in favour of
not guilty raise your hand.

1137
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Three...

1138
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,000
...still the same.

1139
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,800
Three not guilty, nine guilty.

1140
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,100
So, where are we?

1141
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,700
I mean, come on, we can yakety-yakety
until next Tuesday. Where is it getting us?

1142
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Pardon me...

1143
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,500
I would like to change my vote.

1144
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,300
I vote not guilty.

1145
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,900
Oh brother!

1146
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,400
Come on now, listen, what
are you talking about?

1147
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,800
We're all going crazy in here!

1148
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,800
This kid is guilty.

1149
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,100
Why don't you pay
attention to the facts?

1150
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Tell him, will you?

1151
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,400
This is gotta be a god damn joke!

1152
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,100
The vote is 8 to 4 in favour of guilty.

1153
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,700
I mean, everybody's heart is starting
to bleed for this punk little kid,

1154
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,500
like the president just declared

1155
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,900
"Love Your Underpriviledged Brother
Week" or something... Listen to me!

1156
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,100
I want you to tell me why you changed
your vote. Come on, give me reasons!

1157
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,700
I do not have to defend myself to
you. I now have reasonable doubt.

1158
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,600
"Reasonable doubt"...
That's nothing but words!

1159
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,100
Look at the knife!

1160
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,500
The kid you just decided is not guilty was
seen ramming that thing into his father.

1161
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,200
Well, look at it, Mr.
"Reasonable Doubt"!

1162
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,700
That's not the knife...

1163
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,100
...don't you remember?

1164
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Brilliant!

1165
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,600
You know this is the craziest...

1166
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,600
I mean, you're pulling
stories out of thin air.

1167
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,300
What are we supposed to believe?

1168
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,900
I'm telling you, if this guy
was sitting ringside at the

1169
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
Tyson Holyfield fight, he'd
be trying to tell us Tyson won!

1170
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,700
Look, what about the old man, eh?

1171
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,000
Are we supposed to believe
that he didn't get up and run

1172
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,300
to his front door and see that
kid tearing down the stairs,

1173
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,100
15 seconds after the killing?

1174
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,800
He's only saying it so he
can be important, right?

1175
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,300
- I mean, what's the point of this...
- Wait... wait a second, wait a second!

1176
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,000
The Milwakee rooter is
heard from and pop-ups

1177
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,900
are fallin' for base
hits wherever we look at.

1178
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,800
Did the old man say he run to the door?

1179
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,100
Run, walked, what's the
difference? He got there!

1180
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,100
He said he run.

1181
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,000
I don't remember what he said,
but I don't see how he could run!

1182
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,100
He said he run, he run from his bedroom
to the front door. That's enough, isn't it?

1183
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,100
Where exactly was that bedroom again?

1184
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,400
It was down in the hall
somewhere. You don't remember that?

1185
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,900
- No...
- I thought you remembered everything!

1186
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,300
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see a
diagram of the apartment again please.

1187
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,800
Why don't we run the trial over just to
see if we can get everything straight...

1188
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,000
- Mr. Foreman...
- I heard you.

1189
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,100
What's all this for?

1190
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,900
How come you're the only one in the room
who wants to see exhibits all the time.

1191
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I wanna see this one too!

1192
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,400
And I wanna stop wasting time...

1193
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,300
If we are going to start
wading through all this

1194
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,400
business about where the
body was found, then we can...

1195
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,300
No, we're not!

1196
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,400
I just wanna find out if a man who
limps because he had a stroke a year ago,

1197
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,800
can get from his bed to his
front door in 15 seconds.

1198
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,300
He said 20 seconds...

1199
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,000
- 15! - I'm telling you he said
20. Why do you always distort him?

1200
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,100
He said 15...

1201
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,300
How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1202
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,500
You can't judge a thing like that!

1203
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,300
He said 15 seconds. He
was very positive about it.

1204
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,300
He's an old man, you saw him.
Half the time he was confused!

1205
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,900
How could he be positive
ab... about anything?

1206
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,200
I don't see what we're
going to prove here.

1207
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,100
The man said he saw the boy running
out, that's what he said to us.

1208
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,900
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

1209
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,500
Now, the minute the body fell,
the old man says he heard footsteps

1210
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,400
running towards the front door upstairs.

1211
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,900
Then he heard that upstairs door open and
the footsteps continued down the stairway.

1212
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,500
He got to his front
door as fast as he could,

1213
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
swears it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds,

1214
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,400
- Now if the killer started to run
immediately... - Well, maybe he didn't!

1215
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,100
The old man says he did.

1216
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,000
You oughta be down at Atlantic City
at the hair-splitters' convention.

1217
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,100
Hey baseball, why don't you stop
with the smart remarks all the time?

1218
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,300
Oh my friend, for your $15 a day
you gotta listen to everything.

1219
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,200
Ok, now you got that thing
in here... What about it?

1220
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,100
May I?

1221
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,400
Ok, this is the apartment
where the killing took place.

1222
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,500
The old man's apartment is exactly
like it, directly underneath.

1223
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,200
Now, here's the el line,

1224
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,000
here's the bedroom, living
room, the kitchen and the bath,

1225
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,800
here's the hallway and way
down there is the front door

1226
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,400
to the apartment and here
are the steps that go down.

1227
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,400
Now, the old man was
in bed in this room.

1228
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,100
He says he got up,
he went into the hall,

1229
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,900
went all the way down the
hall, opened the front door,

1230
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
just in time to see the
boy racing down the stairs.

1231
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,200
Am I right?

1232
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,000
That's the story... for the 19th time!

1233
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,900
15 seconds after he heard the body fall.

1234
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,000
Correct...

1235
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,600
The old man's bed was by the window.

1236
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,800
That means he had to walk... 12
feet from the bed to the bedroom door

1237
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,500
and the hall is... 43 feet 6
inches... down to the front door.

1238
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:14,500
That means that he had to get up, get out
of bed, walk 12 feet, open the bedroom door,

1239
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,900
walk 43 feet and open the
front door to his apartment,

1240
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,800
all in 15 seconds...

1241
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,200
Does anyone think he could have done it?

1242
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,300
- Sure he could have done it!
- He can only walk very slowly...

1243
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,300
There they helped him
to the witness chair...

1244
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,200
You make it sound like
a long walk! It's not!

1245
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,000
For an old man who's had a
stroke... it's a long walk!

1246
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,800
What are you doing?

1247
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,700
I wanna set this up,
see how long it took him.

1248
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,900
What do you mean you wanna set this up?

1249
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,000
Why didn't the kid's lawyer
bring it up if it's so important?

1250
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,300
Maybe he just didn't think of it!

1251
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,100
What do you mean he didn't think of it? Do
you think the guy's an idiot or something?

1252
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,200
- It's an obvious thing, isn't it?
- Did you think of it?

1253
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,600
Look smart guy, don't matter what,
I thought of it over the night.

1254
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,200
Alright, let's calm it down.

1255
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,900
He didn't bring it up cause he
thought it was gonna hurt his case.

1256
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,300
Wait a minute! Maybe he didn't bring
it up because it would seem as if

1257
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,800
he was badgering and
pressuring a helpless old man,

1258
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,500
which does not sit well with a jury,

1259
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,100
lawyers try to avoid that
sort of thing if they can...

1260
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,700
What kind of bum is he then?

1261
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,700
That's exactly what I've been asking!

1262
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,400
Now, let's say this
is the old man's bed.

1263
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,400
First, I'm gonna pace off 12 feet,
that's the length of the bedroom.

1264
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,000
You're crazy! You can't
recreate a thing like that!

1265
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,600
You wanna do me a favour?
Could you hand me that chair?

1266
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,800
Put it right here...
This is the bedroom door.

1267
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,600
Now the hallway was...
what? It was 43 feet.

1268
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,400
Well, I'll pace over to that wall
and then back around this way again.

1269
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,100
This is absolutely insane! What's the idea
behind wasting everybody's time with this?

1270
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,200
...11... 12... Look, it's only gonna
take 15 seconds according to you!

1271
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,900
...40... 41... 42... 43.

1272
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,300
If you would... thank you very much!

1273
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,100
This is the doorway out into the
hall and the stairway going down.

1274
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,700
It was chain locked
according to testimony.

1275
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,000
Now, does anybody here got
a second hand on their watch?

1276
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,100
I have.

1277
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,400
Alright. Will you just stamp
your foot when you want me to go,

1278
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,300
that'll be the body falling, alright?

1279
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,300
Time me from then.

1280
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,700
Anybody for charades?

1281
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,500
- I've never seen anything like this
in my whole... - Alright, I'm ready.

1282
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,400
Come on, come on, won't you?

1283
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,500
I'm waiting for the
second hand to reach sixty.

1284
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,300
Go!

1285
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,200
Oh come on, step it up, he
walked twice as fast as that!

1286
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,000
That's too slow!

1287
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That's how he walked, he
walked like an old man!

1288
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,600
... what will this kid's stuff do?

1289
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,400
- No. That's too slow...
- ... that's the way he walked.

1290
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,800
You want me to walk faster?
Alright, I'll walk faster.

1291
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,300
- This is a trial for murder!
- Relax, will ya? Jeez!

1292
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Time!

1293
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,600
Exactly 42 seconds!

1294
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,400
42 seconds?

1295
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,300
42 seconds.

1296
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,200
Here's what I think happened.

1297
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,600
I think the old man heard the fight
between the boy and his father earlier

1298
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,100
and then a couple of
hours later, lying in bed,

1299
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,700
he heard the body hit the
floor at the boy's apartment

1300
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,000
and heard the woman
scream across the street.

1301
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,200
He tried to get to the front door.

1302
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,600
He heard someone running down the stairs
and he assumed that it was the boy.

1303
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,100
I think that's possible.

1304
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Assumed?

1305
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,400
Now listen to me people!

1306
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:39,200
I've heard all kinds of dishonesty
in my day, but this little display...

1307
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,900
...takes the cake! You come in here,

1308
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,200
with your sanctimonious talk
about slum kids and injustice

1309
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,400
and you make up a lot of wild stories

1310
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,800
and all of a sudden you're gettin' through
to some of these little old ladies in here.

1311
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,900
But you're not getting
through to me! I've had enough!

1312
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,800
What is the matter with you people?

1313
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,000
Everyone of you knows he's
guilty! He's got to burn!

1314
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,500
We'll let him slip through our fingers!

1315
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,300
"... let him slip through our fingers...
" What are you, his executioner?

1316
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm one of them!

1317
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,400
Maybe you'd like to put the needle in!

1318
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,800
For this kid? You bet I would!

1319
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,300
God, I'm sorry for you...

1320
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Don't start with me now!

1321
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,200
Ever since we've walked into this room,

1322
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,700
you've acted like a
self-appointed public avenger.

1323
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Shut up!

1324
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,500
You want the boy to die for your own
personal reasons, not because of the facts!

1325
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,100
You're a sadist!

1326
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,400
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

1327
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1328
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,000
What the hell's going on here?

1329
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,700
Nothing.

1330
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,100
Just a little argument, everything's
fine brother, everything is...

1331
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,100
...fine.

1332
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,200
Just.. things just got a little heated.

1333
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Thank you.

1334
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,400
What are you staring at?

1335
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,900
Well, I suppose we need someone
else to start this off again, eh?

1336
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,200
It's getting late.

1337
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,800
What do they do? Take us out
to a restaurant or something?

1338
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
I don't know.

1339
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,700
I sure hope they let us go home in
case we don't finish this case tonight.

1340
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,600
My little grandson has
the mumps, face up to here,

1341
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,400
my wife says he looks like Fat Albo...

1342
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,400
Well, look guys,

1343
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,800
if noone else has any ideas, I
might have a cute one here, I mean...

1344
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,300
...I ain't putting my stock into it,
but let me throw it out in the stoop,

1345
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,600
see if the cat licks
it up, what do you say?

1346
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,800
"... the cat licks it up"

1347
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,300
Yeah... it's an expression...

1348
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,500
It wasn't much of an idea really...

1349
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,400
Look how dark it's getting there.

1350
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,500
We're gonna have a storm.

1351
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,600
- Well...
- Boy, it's hot!

1352
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Don't you sweat?

1353
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,600
No, no, I don't...

1354
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
I don't either.

1355
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,800
Well, listen! I'm wondering...
maybe we could take another vote.

1356
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,400
Yeah... Maybe we can follow this
one up with dancing and refreshments!

1357
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,300
- Mr. Foreman...
- Alright with me.

1358
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Anyone who doesn't wanna vote?

1359
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,600
I think we should have an open ballot.
Call out your votes, see who stands where.

1360
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,100
Alright... The last vote was
8 to 4 in favour of guilty.

1361
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,800
I'll just call out your jury numbers.

1362
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,100
I vote guilty. Number 2?

1363
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Not guilty.

1364
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Number 3?

1365
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Guilty.

1366
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,000
- Number 4?
- Guilty.

1367
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Number 5...

1368
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Not guilty.

1369
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,300
Number 6...

1370
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Not guilty.

1371
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,600
Number 7...

1372
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Guilty.

1373
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
Number 8...

1374
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,900
Not guilty.

1375
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,300
- Number 9...
- Not guilty.

1376
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,600
Number 10...

1377
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,100
He's guilty brother.

1378
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,100
Number 11...

1379
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,300
Not guilty.

1380
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,300
Number 12...

1381
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,700
Guilty.

1382
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,200
6 to 6.

1383
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,100
And we go into extra innings here.

1384
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,200
6 to 6!

1385
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,200
Well, I'm telling you, some of you people
have lost your damn minds! A kid like that!

1386
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,800
I don't think the kind of boy
has anything to do with it.

1387
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1388
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,200
Oh, don't give me any of that "facts"!

1389
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1390
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Twist'em any way you want to!

1391
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,700
Facts! Facts!

1392
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:46,000
That's... That's exactly the point
that this gentleman has been making!

1393
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
You... You keep shouting
at the top of your lungs

1394
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,400
as though that were some
sort of solution, I mean...

1395
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
I just wish I was a little younger...

1396
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,800
- It's gonna rain.
- No! How did you figure that out?

1397
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,700
How come you switched?

1398
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,300
Well, it just seemed...

1399
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,000
You haven't got a leg
to stand on, don't you?

1400
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,700
I don't feel that way.

1401
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,600
- There were a lot of details
that didn't come out. - Details?

1402
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,200
Look, you just let
yourself to get bulldozed by

1403
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,100
a bunch of these old
white washed intellectuals.

1404
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,600
- That's not so!
- Oh come on, this is me!

1405
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,800
You're just like some other folks your
age, you're scared of the white man!

1406
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,100
They say something, you get low...

1407
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,100
Hey you, listen!

1408
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,400
- ... you make stuff I said!
- You have no right to...

1409
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
You... loudmouth!

1410
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,300
- Oh oh! Here it comes!
- Look at that.

1411
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,600
Get that window, come on!

1412
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,600
What's with this window here?

1413
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,900
Let's try to get this air conditioning
working in here, what do you say, eh?

1414
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,700
Hey! Look at this!

1415
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,200
Hey, it must have been connected
to the light switch, eh?

1416
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,100
Some rain, eh?

1417
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,800
And what about this thing
- even Steven...

1418
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,300
Kinda surprising, isn't it?

1419
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,600
Yeah, yeah...

1420
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,200
You know, that business before,
when that guy was baiting me...

1421
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,700
That doesn't prove anything! I'm
a very excitable person, I mean...

1422
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,900
Where does he come off calling me a
public avenger and a sadist and everything?

1423
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,100
Anybody in his right mind
would've blown his stack, right?

1424
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,500
He... was just tryin' to bait me.

1425
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,300
He did an excellent job.

1426
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,000
Man, look at it go...

1427
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,300
You know, it reminds me of the...

1428
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,100
...city championships three years ago.

1429
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,100
What a game!

1430
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,600
Score was tie, 21-21, it
could've gone out of the way...

1431
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,300
We had this young brother Yelder.

1432
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,500
Great kid.

1433
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,400
Quiet, respectful, wiry,

1434
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,000
but he could shake
you out of your shoes!

1435
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,300
Nobody could touch him.

1436
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,700
I'm the football coach over at Bay Side.

1437
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,000
These gaps he just
started to have around him,

1438
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,600
the refs said they requested
the game just to see him play.

1439
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,100
He was renowned... I mean... I...

1440
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,600
I'd built the whole team around him.

1441
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,000
I knew better, but I...

1442
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,100
...but I loved the kid.

1443
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,700
We came out at half time and it..

1444
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,200
...already began pouring.

1445
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,100
Now, at the 4rth quarter
the field was mud bath!

1446
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,400
Yelder of course, he
couldn't get to sweating.

1447
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,900
He sat scatback and there
it was a big fullback

1448
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:53,100
that's rammed down our
throats and... won the game.

1449
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
But, you know...

1450
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,400
I'll always remember...

1451
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,500
Yelder after the game...

1452
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,100
sitting on the bench...

1453
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,500
still in his uniform...

1454
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,800
staring off into... space.

1455
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,400
His... broken heart!

1456
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,200
Isn't that the dumbest
thing you ever saw? 6 to 6!

1457
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
It's a joke!

1458
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,300
What are we gonna do about
it? Can we break it somehow?

1459
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,100
Yeah, well, six fools in there
aren't gonna change their minds...

1460
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,200
I thought they already
have changed their mind.

1461
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,500
There's no reason why they can't
be persuaded to do it again.

1462
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,800
And how?

1463
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,900
Just by using logic!

1464
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
Yeah, logic, eh?

1465
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,400
You listen to this man, he's the
only one in the room who knows.

1466
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,800
Hey, you want my opinion?

1467
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
Go ahead.

1468
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,500
I think we should just quit.

1469
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,500
What are you talking about?

1470
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,100
I mean, come on, these
six people in there,

1471
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,700
all of a sudden they act like it's
some kind of mission or something.

1472
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,300
I mean, come on,
they're not gonna switch.

1473
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,400
Let's just go to the judge
or we'll be here all night.

1474
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,900
Let's just go and tell
her that we're hung.

1475
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
To hell with this!

1476
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:21,400
What am I supposed to do? Break my
brain over some... scum like that?

1477
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,300
You took an oath in the courtroom!

1478
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
You can't just quit.

1479
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,700
Why not?

1480
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's dishonest!

1481
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,400
Why don't you just vote not guilty?

1482
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
No, I voted guilty cause
I think he's guilty!

1483
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,200
- But you don't care about what
happens to him! - No, why should I?

1484
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,700
Stop this! We're not going
to get anywhere like this.

1485
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,800
I mean, come on, what does he
want? I gave him an honest opinion.

1486
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,900
I know.

1487
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,800
Oh, I suppose you don't
think much of it...

1488
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
No, I don't!

1489
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,200
How about him? Is that something?

1490
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,000
Ah well, a hung jury
doesn't mean anything.

1491
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,300
Just have to start the trial
again with another jury.

1492
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,300
That's not what we're here for...

1493
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,500
What the hell is the difference?

1494
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,900
A hung jury's what you're gonna get!

1495
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,000
Alright, look! I'll tell
you what I think, alright?

1496
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,200
We ain't going nowhere in here!

1497
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,100
I'm ready to go into court right
now and declare a hung jury.

1498
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Yeah, I go for that too!

1499
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,600
Come on, let's take it to the judge.

1500
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,500
Let this kid take his
chances with 12 other guys.

1501
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,700
The court is not going to accept a hung
jury. We haven't been here long enough.

1502
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,700
Well, let's find out!

1503
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm not in favour of this.

1504
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,300
Listen, this kid wouldn't stand a
chance with another jury and you know it.

1505
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,000
Come on, we're hung...

1506
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,000
Nobody's gonna change their
opinion! Let's take it inside.

1507
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,400
You still don't think there's
any room for reasonable doubt?

1508
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,900
No, I don't.

1509
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,200
Pardon, maybe you do not fully
understand the term reasonable doubt.

1510
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,200
Oh, what do you mean I don't understand?

1511
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,800
Who the hell are you
to talk to me like that?

1512
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,500
How do you like this guy,
eh? I'm telling you...

1513
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,100
They're all the same...

1514
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,900
You come over to this
country running for your life

1515
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,600
and before you can take a big breath
he's telling us how to run the show.

1516
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,600
The arrogance of this guy!

1517
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,700
- Oh you call him arrogant cause he
wasn't born here. - Please don't...-

1518
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
Well, I'm calling you arrogant
cause you were, how's that?

1519
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,400
- Hey look, sonny...
- And who the hell are you calling sonny?

1520
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Hey look, sonny!

1521
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,200
Nobody around here's gonna tell me what
words I understand and what words I don't.

1522
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,700
Especially him!

1523
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,500
Cause I'll knock his middle
eastern European god damn head off!

1524
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,000
Alright, cut the bullshit.

1525
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,100
We're not going in as a hung jury.

1526
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,700
Come on, let's get back to work.

1527
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,700
I think there's something I would like to
discuss, if it's alright with you gentlemen.

1528
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,000
An important point the prosecution
raised, was the fact that the boy,

1529
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,800
having said that he was at the movies,

1530
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,100
during the time the murder occured,

1531
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,300
could not remember the names of the
films or the stars that were in them.

1532
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,400
- This gentleman has raised that
point several times. - That's correct.

1533
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,400
It was the only alibi the boy offered

1534
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,600
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

1535
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,500
Well, putting yourself in
the boy's place, if you can,

1536
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,200
do you think that you would
be able to remember details

1537
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,500
after an experience such as your
father hitting you on the face?

1538
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,500
Yes, I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1539
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,800
He couldn't remember
the movies at the theatre

1540
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,200
he named because he
wasn't there that night.

1541
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,600
Well, the police said they interrogated
the boy in the kitchen of his apartment,

1542
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,600
while his father's body lay
on the floor of the bedroom.

1543
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,100
Do you think that you could remember
details under a situation such as that?

1544
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Yes, I do.

1545
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
Under extreme emotional stress?

1546
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,300
Under extreme emotional
stress, yes, yes...

1547
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,200
Of course, in court, he did
remember the names of the pictures

1548
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,000
and he remembered the names of
the stars that appeared in them.

1549
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,600
Oh, yes! His lawyer took
great pains to bring that out.

1550
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,300
He had three months from
the night of the murder

1551
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,800
to the day of the trial
in which to memorise them.

1552
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:30,700
I'll take the testimony of the policemen
who interrogated him right after the murder.

1553
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,000
Then he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies.

1554
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,400
Great emotional stress or not!

1555
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,600
Ok... Could I ask you
a personal question?

1556
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Oh, please, go ahead, go ahead...

1557
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,700
Where were you last night?

1558
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,100
I was home, yes..

1559
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,900
Ok... The night before that?

1560
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Hey, come on, what is this?

1561
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,500
It's perfectly alright... wait, wait...

1562
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,700
The night before...

1563
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,900
I went from home to my office, stayed until
8:30, then I went straight home to bed, yes.

1564
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,600
Alright... and the night before that?

1565
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,600
That was... Tuesday...
thank you, Tuesday.

1566
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,600
That was the night of the bridge
tournament... Yes, yes, I played bridge.

1567
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,300
And Monday night?

1568
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,600
When you get them down to New
Year's Eve 1972, let me know!

1569
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,500
Wait, wait...

1570
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,700
Monday night...

1571
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
...Oh yes! My wife and
I went to the movies.

1572
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,600
Ah... What did you see?

1573
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,600
"Lies... and... secrets".

1574
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,800
It was a very touching story
about a black woman who...

1575
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:28,900
Excuse me!

1576
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,900
It's called "Secrets and lies".

1577
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,400
"Secrets and lies", yes...

1578
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,200
Correct. And who was
in "Secrets and lies"?

1579
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,300
Wait, wait, wait a minute... It was
something with a 'B'... it was 'Be'...

1580
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
I think...

1581
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,800
Yeah, Bella, Bella... Bella...

1582
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,800
It was Brenda.

1583
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Brenda,

1584
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
...was her name. And
what was her last name?

1585
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,900
It was an english movie...

1586
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,700
The actors that I'm not familiar with...

1587
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,700
...There was something with 'U'...

1588
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1589
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,200
And you weren't under great emotional
stress at the time, were you?

1590
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,200
No sir, I... wasn't... sorry.

1591
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,500
I think the point is made!

1592
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,000
Yeah, big point!

1593
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,400
I think it is a big point.

1594
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,800
What, because he couldn't remember the
name of a couple of two brit movie stars?

1595
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,600
Oh well, I guess that proves that
the kid was at the movies then.

1596
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,800
No, but it indicates that
noone can prove that he wasn't.

1597
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,300
He might have been at the
movies and forgotten what he saw,

1598
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,900
it's possible...

1599
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,600
If it's perfectly logical for this
gentleman to forget a few details,

1600
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,300
it's perfectly logical for the boy!

1601
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:45,100
Being accused of murder isn't supposed
to give him an infallible memory.

1602
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,600
Man, you can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the ground, ok?

1603
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,700
The kid is guilty, period!

1604
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,100
You know what I mean, my friend?

1605
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,400
Who's got the cough drops?

1606
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,700
They're all gone... my friend.

1607
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,400
You know, there's something we're forgetting
here, that I was just thinking about

1608
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,400
and that's that old business
that dragged down forever

1609
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,600
with the psychiatrists, where
he got all involved with...

1610
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:14,300
Oh come on, don't start with all that
phony, psycho, whatsyoucallem stuff!

1611
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,800
That boy would have reckon that is, fill
the people's heads with all that junk.

1612
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,700
I got three psychiatrists bringing
in collars to my detail shop,

1613
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
the whole three of
them bullies is crazy!

1614
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
I'm trying to make a point...

1615
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,900
I will give you a buffalo nickel for a

1616
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,100
psychiatrist's testimony,
I would... I would!

1617
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,900
Why won't you let the man talk?

1618
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,700
You can do five minutes on the usages
of psychiatry after he's through.

1619
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
What I was gonna say,

1620
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,100
was that the psychiatrist
definitely stated

1621
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,300
that the boy had strong
homicidal tendencies,

1622
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
that he was capable of commiting murder.

1623
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,200
He also described all those tests, etc.

1624
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,200
The boy definitely was the
killer type, am I right?

1625
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,900
I think he said something about
paranoid enmities, if I'm not mistaken.

1626
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That's right!

1627
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,800
Let's just try to remember he said it.

1628
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,800
Let's not forget that
we're talking about a

1629
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,100
boy here who's always
had murder on his mind.

1630
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,300
His unconscious mind!

1631
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,300
I beg your pardon! In discussing...

1632
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,600
"I beg your pardon"! Why
are you so damn polite about?

1633
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:11,500
For the same reason that you are not:
It was the way I was brought up...

1634
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,500
In discussing such a thing
as the murder potential,

1635
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,300
we must remember that many of us are capable
of commiting murder, but few of us do.

1636
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,000
We impose controls upon
ourselves to prevent it.

1637
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,500
Now the most that these psychiatric tests
can accomplish along these lines is this...

1638
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,300
They can tell us that some day, a
particular person may commit murder.

1639
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,600
That is all! They prove nothing!

1640
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,500
Then how come they're
admitted in evidence?

1641
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,500
They have many uses, of course...

1642
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,700
In this case, they added to the general

1643
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,000
impression the prosecution
was trying to create.

1644
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,200
Perhaps we would find,

1645
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,100
if the twelve of us
men took the same tests,

1646
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,900
one or two of us might be discovered
to have the subconscious desires to kill

1647
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,500
and the potentiality
of carrying them out.

1648
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,800
Yet, none of us has...

1649
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,800
To say that the man
is capable of murder,

1650
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
does not mean that he
has commited murder.

1651
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,300
Yeah, but it could mean it!

1652
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,200
Look, if they said that this kid is capable
of killing, he could've killed, couldn't he?

1653
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,400
You're the one who said and I quote:

1654
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,500
"I wouldn't give a buffalo nickel
for a psychiatrist's testimony"!

1655
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,900
5 to 6...

1656
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,100
Look at that rain...

1657
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,500
There goes the old ball game.

1658
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:30,700
Say... Say... Could I see
that knife for a second?

1659
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,900
Alright gentlemen...

1660
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,400
...we're still tied 6 to 6.

1661
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,600
- Who's got a suggestion?
- I do. Where's that dinner?

1662
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,400
- Let's go until 7, give it another hour.
- Ok.

1663
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,300
Listen... Something...
Something I wanna say.

1664
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,900
It's been bothering me a little and...

1665
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,900
as long as we're stuck...

1666
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Well,

1667
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,700
there was this whole
business about the stab wound,

1668
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,400
how it was made, the
downward angle, you know?

1669
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,000
You're not gonna start that
again, they went over 'n' over it!

1670
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,400
I know they did, but I...

1671
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,900
...I can't go along with it.

1672
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
The boy...

1673
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,300
...was, what, 5 feet
7 inches tall, right?

1674
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,000
And according to the medical
examiner, the father was 6 feet 2.

1675
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,900
Now, that's a difference of 7 inches.

1676
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,500
Now, it's an awkward thing to...

1677
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:36,200
stab down into somebody's chest when he's
more than half a foot taller than you are.

1678
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,800
Give me that thing!

1679
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,200
You won't be satisfied
till you see this again,

1680
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,700
so I'm gonna give you
a little demonstration.

1681
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,200
Somebody get up.

1682
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:51,900
Ok...

1683
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,300
Watch this please, I don't
wanna have to do it again.

1684
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,500
I'm about 6 or 7 inches
shorter than you, right?

1685
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,000
Yeah, maybe even a little more.

1686
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,700
Well, let it be more.

1687
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,400
- Hey, that ain't funny!
- What's the matter with you?

1688
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,800
Calm down...

1689
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,100
Nobody's hurt, right?

1690
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,300
Nobody's hurt.

1691
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,500
Now...

1692
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,400
...there's you angle. Take
a look at it. Down and in.

1693
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,900
That's the way I would stab a taller
man and that's the way it was done.

1694
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,100
Now go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.

1695
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,600
Down and in! That's how it was done.

1696
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,000
Wait a minute, wait a
minute! Let me see that!

1697
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,300
This is a stiletto, not a switchblade.

1698
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,400
I hate these things!

1699
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,400
I grew up with them.

1700
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,200
Have you ever seen them used in a fight?

1701
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,600
Too many of them.

1702
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,700
On my stoop, in my backyard...

1703
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,500
...a lot across the street...

1704
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,200
These came with the
neighbourhood where I lived.

1705
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,300
It's funny I wasn't thinking of it...

1706
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,800
I guess I try to forget those things...

1707
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,100
You can't use this
kind of knife that way.

1708
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
You have to hold it like
this to release the blade.

1709
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,100
In order to stab downwards
you have to change your grip.

1710
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:25,100
Well, how do you use it?

1711
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,100
Underhand, like this.

1712
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,400
Anyone who's ever used one of these
would never handle it any other way.

1713
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,100
Are you sure?

1714
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,100
Yeah, I'm sure. That's
why it's made like this.

1715
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,700
Well, we all agree that that boy is
pretty handy with the knife, right?

1716
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Yeah, that's right.

1717
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,200
You think he could have made the
kind of wound that killed his father?

1718
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,400
Not with the experience he'd had using
these things, no, I don't think he would.

1719
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,600
He'd go for my laying...

1720
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,900
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1721
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
No... neither was anyone else.

1722
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,600
You're giving us a lot of
mumbo jumbo, I don't believe it!

1723
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,400
I don't think you can
determine the type of

1724
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,700
wounds this boy might
or might not have made,

1725
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,200
simply because he knows
how to handle a knife.

1726
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,700
That's right, that's absolutely right!

1727
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,600
What do you think?

1728
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,100
Well...

1729
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,200
...I don't know.

1730
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,500
What do you mean you don't know?

1731
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I don't know!

1732
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,600
How about you?

1733
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,900
Hey listen, listen, listen...
I'll tell you something...

1734
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,800
Now, I'm a little sick of this
whole thing already, you know?

1735
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,700
I mean, all this yapping
is getting us nowhere!

1736
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,800
So, I'm gonna break it up here.

1737
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,800
I'm changing my vote to not guilty!

1738
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,900
You're what?

1739
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,000
You heard me. I... I've had enough!

1740
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,900
What do you mean you've had
enough? That's no answer!

1741
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,500
Hey listen, you... You
just worry about yourself!

1742
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,600
He's right!

1743
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,400
That is not an answer!

1744
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,500
What kind of man are you?

1745
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,700
You have been sitting here,
voting guilty with everyone else,

1746
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,300
because there are a couple of baseball
tickets burning a hole in your pocket?

1747
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,900
And now you say you're
going to change your vote

1748
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,900
because you've had enough
with all the talking?

1749
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,000
Alright, listen buddy...

1750
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,300
You cannot do this!

1751
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,400
You cannot play like
this with a man's life!

1752
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,800
What is wrong with you?

1753
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,800
It is a terrible and ugly
thing to do! Do you not care?

1754
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,000
Hey, wait a minute!

1755
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,000
You can't talk like that to me!

1756
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I can talk like that to you!

1757
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,400
Now, if you want to vote not guilty,

1758
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,700
then do it because you are
convinced that the man is not guilty,

1759
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,100
not because you've had enough.

1760
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,100
If you want to vote
guilty, then vote that way.

1761
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,200
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1762
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,500
Hey now, listen buddy!

1763
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,400
Guilty or not guilty?

1764
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,000
I told you, not guilty!

1765
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:27,900
Why?

1766
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,800
God damn you, I don't
have to tell you anything!

1767
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,500
Yes, you do! Say it, why?

1768
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,300
Cause I don't think he's guilty...

1769
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,700
Mr. Foreman, I wish to
call for another vote.

1770
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,600
Alright gentlemen,

1771
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,000
another vote is called for.

1772
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,300
And the quickest way
is to show off hands.

1773
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,900
Anybody object?

1774
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,200
All those in favour of not
guilty raise your hands.

1775
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:31,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 8.

1776
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,900
9.

1777
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:44,000
All those voting
guilty, raise your hand.

1778
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,200
1... 2...

1779
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,200
...3.

1780
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,200
The vote is 9 to 3 in
favour of not guilty.

1781
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,200
I don't understand you people!

1782
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,700
I mean, all these little picky points
you keep bringing up don't mean nothing!

1783
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,900
They don't mean nothing!

1784
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,300
How can you believe this story?

1785
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,500
You're an intelligent man
and you're not gonna tell me

1786
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,600
that you're not, you
know the facts of life.

1787
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,400
Just look at what
we're dealing with here.

1788
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,600
You know him!

1789
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,900
You know this kid!

1790
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,400
This guy other here, I don't know
what the hell is going on with him,

1791
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,700
all that talk about psychiatrists...
Maybe he ought to go to one!

1792
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,100
Now look! Let's talk facts.

1793
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,600
These people are born to lie.

1794
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,200
Now, that's the way they are and no
intelligent man is gonna tell me otherwise.

1795
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,500
They don't know what the truth
is! You take a look at them!

1796
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,600
They're different!

1797
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,400
They think different, they act different

1798
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,000
and they don't need some big
excuse to kill somebody either.

1799
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,900
Well, it's true! Everybody knows it.

1800
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,600
Smoking that crack...
Nothing but crack he is!

1801
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,900
Look at him, smart guy...

1802
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,900
...what's that mean, slam the door?...

1803
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,800
Anyway, these people
they get all drugged up

1804
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,700
and BANG!

1805
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,700
All of a sudden somebody's
lying dead in the gutter...

1806
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,700
Ok, look, nobody's blaming'em for.

1807
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,100
That's just the way they are
by nature, you know what I mean?

1808
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,500
They're violent! And human life don't
mean as much to them as it does to us.

1809
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
Where are you going?

1810
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,800
Where are you going?

1811
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,100
Look, while you're in
there, maybe you ought to

1812
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,200
clean out your ears,
maybe you can hear then.

1813
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,700
Now look, listen to me now!

1814
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,100
These spics! They stay high on
dope and they fight all the time...

1815
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,200
Look, if somebody gets killed, so
somebody gets killed, they don't care!

1816
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,800
They breed like animals...

1817
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,800
Ok, sure, there's some
good things about them...

1818
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,400
Look, I'm the first
guy to tell you that...

1819
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,400
I've known some who were ok...

1820
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,100
...but that's the exception!

1821
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,000
You know you're a sick man?

1822
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,200
- Sick?
- Why don't you sit down?

1823
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
You old son of a bitch! Who are you?

1824
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,600
No, who the hell is he to tell me that?

1825
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,500
Sick... Look at him!
He can hardly stand up!

1826
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,400
No, I'm speaking my piece here
today and you're listening!

1827
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,900
- Maybe you should...
- You shut up, you sit down!

1828
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,400
There's not one of them,...
not one, that's any good!

1829
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,800
NOT ONE!

1830
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,500
You hear that?

1831
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,500
Sympathetic bastards!

1832
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,800
And you were to wonder
you're so god damn smart...

1833
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,500
We're facing a danger,
don't you know that?

1834
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,700
These wetbacks are
multiplying like rabbits!

1835
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,400
They come over here illegally

1836
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,800
and they're multiplying five
times faster than my people!

1837
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,000
That's five times, brothers!

1838
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,400
And they're wild animals!

1839
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,400
They're against us, they hate us!

1840
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,000
They want to destroy us!

1841
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:31,800
They come over here and they benefit
from everything that we've built!

1842
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,300
That's right! Don't
look at me like that...

1843
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,500
There's a danger...

1844
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:38,200
We are living in a
dangerous time, brothers!

1845
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:43,200
If we don't smack them down, if we
don't do something, every chance we get,

1846
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,800
then they're gonna own us!

1847
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,100
- They're gonna bring us out of existance...
- Shut up!

1848
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,900
...I'm warning you! You listen to me...

1849
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,800
I'm telling you, this boy...

1850
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,300
...put this boy on trial, we got him.

1851
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,900
We got him!

1852
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,200
That's one at least!

1853
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,400
I say that we get him,
before his kind gets us!

1854
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,300
I don't give a damn about the law!

1855
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,100
Why should I? They don't!

1856
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
- Now, I'm telling you...
- I've heard enough!

1857
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,900
Won't you just stop all of this!

1858
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,100
Come on, wake up man! We
can make a difference here!

1859
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,200
Sit down...

1860
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,500
...and don't open your
filthy mouth again!

1861
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,400
Alright gentlemen.

1862
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,100
Let's finish what we started.

1863
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,800
You have made some excellent points.

1864
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,600
The last one, in which you proved
that the boy couldn't have made

1865
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,300
that kind of overhand stab
wound was very persuasive.

1866
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,700
But I still believe the boy
is guilty for the murder.

1867
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,600
I have two reasons.

1868
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,000
One: The evidence given by
the woman across the street,

1869
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,600
who actually saw the murder commited.

1870
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,600
...and how... As far as I'm concerned

1871
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,000
that's the most important
testimony in the whole case!

1872
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,400
Two...

1873
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,800
The fact that the woman
described the stabbing by saying

1874
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,300
she saw the boy raise
his arm over his head,

1875
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,100
over his head, right up,

1876
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,400
and plunge the knife down
into his father's chest.

1877
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:33,700
She saw him do it!

1878
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,800
The wrong way!

1879
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,400
That's right, that's absolutely right!

1880
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,600
So let's talk about this
woman for a minute here...

1881
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:45,000
She said that she went to bed at
about 11 o'clock that night, yes.

1882
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,900
Her bed was next to the window,

1883
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:50,000
she could look out while lying down and

1884
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,900
see directly into the boy's
window across the street.

1885
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,900
She tossed and turned for over an hour,

1886
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,800
unable to fall asleep. Finally...

1887
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,300
...she turned towards the window,

1888
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,100
at about 10 minutes after 12,

1889
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,900
and as she looked out,

1890
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:09,500
she saw the killing through the
windows of the passing el train.

1891
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,700
She says, the lights went out
immediately after the killing,

1892
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:19,400
but that she got a good look at the
boy in the act of stabbing his father.

1893
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,200
You know, as far as I can see,

1894
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,000
this is unshakeable testimony!

1895
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,700
That's what I mean, it's the whole case!

1896
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,600
What do you think?

1897
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,000
What about you?

1898
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Well...

1899
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,700
...I don't know, it's...

1900
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,600
There's so many things
to shift through...

1901
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,200
I... I... This is pretty
complicated business...

1902
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,800
Really, I don't see how we
can vote for an acquiter?

1903
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Well...

1904
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,700
...it's just not easy to
arrange the evidence in order.

1905
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,700
You can throw out all
the other evidence!

1906
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,800
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1907
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,400
Well... maybe...

1908
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,500
Let's vote now.

1909
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,400
Alright gentlemen,
another vote is called for.

1910
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,200
Anyone object?

1911
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,800
I'm changing my vote.
I think he's guilty...

1912
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,500
Anybody else?

1913
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,800
What makes you consider this
one vote a personal triumph?

1914
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,300
I'm the competitive type!

1915
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:25,100
Here's what I think... I think we're a hung
jury, let's take it inside to the judge.

1916
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,100
What?

1917
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,400
- You didn't want a hung jury before...
- Well, I do now!

1918
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,000
I... I don't understand that.

1919
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,800
You thought it was immoral.

1920
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,800
I don't anymore...

1921
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,300
People in here are so god damn stubborn!

1922
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,500
We'll never get this done,
we'll be here for a week!

1923
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,700
I wanna hear an argument.

1924
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,500
I say we're a hung jury...

1925
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:49,800
Well, come on!

1926
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,600
You're the leader of
the cause, what about it?

1927
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,300
Let's go over it again.

1928
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,800
We went over it again...

1929
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,600
J. Walter Thomson over here

1930
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,700
has been bouncing back and
forth like a ping pong ball!

1931
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,200
- Wait a minute... You don't
have to call me... - I apologise!

1932
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,500
On my knees!

1933
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:04,900
Come on...

1934
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,700
Let's get out from under this thing, eh?

1935
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,800
Alright, alright...

1936
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:11,400
Maybe we can talk about setting
some kind of a time limit.

1937
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,900
- What's the time?
- Quarter after six.

1938
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,600
Quarter after six... Someone
before mentioned seven o'clock.

1939
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,700
I think that's the point at
which we might begin to discuss

1940
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,300
the question about whether
we are a hung jury, or not.

1941
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,600
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

1942
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,700
Don't you feel well?

1943
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,100
Oh, I feel perfectly
well, thank you very much.

1944
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
I was saying, 7 o'clock would be...

1945
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,600
The reason I asked was that
you were rubbing your nose...

1946
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,600
I'm sorry to interrupt...

1947
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,800
...but you made a gesture,

1948
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,500
that reminded me of
one of the witnesses...

1949
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,700
I was trying to say
something here, do you mind?

1950
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,900
I think this is important!

1951
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,000
Ok, go ahead, please, go ahead...

1952
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Thank you!

1953
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,200
I hope you'll forgive
me for this, but...

1954
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,900
...I was wondering why...

1955
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,200
...why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1956
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,300
Come on now, would you please?

1957
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,900
Right now,

1958
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,500
I'm talking to this gentleman here.

1959
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,300
Now...

1960
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,100
Why were you rubbing your nose?

1961
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,200
Well, if it's any of your business,

1962
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:15,100
I was rubbing it because it bothers me.

1963
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,300
Is it because of your eyeglasses?

1964
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,100
It is, yes, it is, could we
get on to something else please?

1965
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,400
Your eyeglasses make those deep
impressions on the side of your nose.

1966
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,700
Yes...

1967
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,200
I hadn't noticed that before...

1968
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,700
They must be annoying.

1969
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:36,100
Oh yes, oh yes, they
are... Very, very annoying.

1970
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,400
I wouldn't know about that.

1971
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,300
I've never worn eyeglasses.

1972
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,900
20-20!

1973
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,400
Hey come on with the
optometrist bit already!

1974
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,700
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing,

1975
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:55,200
had those same deep marks
on the side of her nose.

1976
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,100
Wow!

1977
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,100
Did you see that?

1978
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,300
Please... please... just a minute!

1979
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,300
Please! Just a minute...

1980
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,100
...and I'll be finished.

1981
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,400
I don't know if any
of you noticed that...

1982
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,400
...I didn't think about it then...

1983
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,500
...but, I've been going
over her face in my mind...

1984
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
She had those marks!

1985
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,800
She kept rubbing them in court...

1986
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,500
- He's right!
- He's right, she did do that a lot!

1987
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,700
This woman,

1988
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,000
was about 45 years old,

1989
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,900
making a tremendous effort to look 35...

1990
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,000
You know, for her first
public appearance...

1991
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,800
Dyed hair, heavy make-up

1992
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,400
and brand new clothes...

1993
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,100
...which would have been more
suitable on a younger woman...

1994
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,200
...and... no eyeglasses!

1995
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,700
See if you can get a picture
a mental picture of her.

1996
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,800
What do you mean no glasses? You
don't know if she wear glasses!

1997
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,400
Just because she was rubbing her nose?

1998
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,300
She had those marks. I saw them!

1999
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,100
So what? What do you think that means?

2000
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,900
I saw them too. He's right!

2001
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,800
I was the closest one to her...

2002
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,600
She had those marks!

2003
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,400
What point are you trying to make here?

2004
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,600
She had them!

2005
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,500
That's the point I'm trying
to make... she had those marks!

2006
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:21,600
She had dyed hair and marks on her nose,
now I'm asking you, what does that mean?

2007
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,200
Could those marks have been made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

2008
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,800
No... no... they couldn't...

2009
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,500
What are you saying?
I didn't see any marks!

2010
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,400
I... I did... yes, I did...

2011
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,000
Strange, I...

2012
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,700
...didn't think about
it before, strange...

2013
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,500
What about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say anything?

2014
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,200
Look, there's twelve people in here
that have been concentrating on this case

2015
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:45,800
and eleven of us didn't think of it.

2016
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,800
Alright... Clarence Daryl!

2017
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,200
What about the district attorney?

2018
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,900
Do you think he'd try to
pull a trick like that,

2019
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,800
letting her testify without her glasses?

2020
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,600
Haven't you ever met a
woman who needed glasses

2021
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,200
but didn't want to wear them because
she thought they ruined her looks?

2022
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,400
Yeah, my wife!

2023
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,800
I'm telling you, she walks out of
the house, she takes off her glasses,

2024
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,900
she puts them in her purse, she walks down
the street and starts bumping into shit...

2025
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:08,100
Maybe the district
attorney didn't know either.

2026
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,300
Just what I was gonna say.

2027
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,500
Alright.

2028
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,300
She had marks on her nose,
I'm giving you that...

2029
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,800
...from glasses...

2030
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,100
...she never wore them
out of the house...

2031
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,200
...so that everybody would
think she was gorgeous!

2032
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,300
But when she saw that kid killing
his father she was in the house!

2033
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,500
Alone...!

2034
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,000
Do you wear your glasses
when you go to bed?

2035
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,600
Noone wears eyeglasses to bed, noone...

2036
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,600
Then it's logical to say that she
wasn't wearing hers in bed either.

2037
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,100
- How do you know?
- I don't know, I'm just guessing.

2038
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,500
And I'm also guessing
that when she glanced out

2039
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,000
the window, she didn't
put her glasses on either.

2040
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:46,700
She herself said that she just looked
out the window, the murder took place

2041
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,100
and one split second
later the lights went out.

2042
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,400
She wouldn't have had time
to put her glasses on then...

2043
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,500
Wait a second!

2044
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,700
And here's another guess.

2045
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,400
Maybe the woman honestly thought
she saw the boy kill his father,

2046
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:59,700
I say, she only saw a blur!

2047
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,100
How do you know what she saw?

2048
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,800
How does he know these things?

2049
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,200
You don't know what
kind of glasses she wore!

2050
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:09,300
Maybe she was farsighted, maybe they were
sunglasses... What do you know about it?

2051
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,600
I only know that the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

2052
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:16,700
She had to identify a person 60 feet
away, in the dark, without glasses.

2053
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,600
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

2054
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,500
Don't give me that!

2055
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,100
You don't think it's possible
that the woman made a mistake?

2056
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,000
No!

2057
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
It's not possible...

2058
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,300
No, it's not possible!

2059
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,300
No 12, is it possible?

2060
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,700
Yes... it's possible...

2061
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,200
...The kid's not guilty!

2062
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,600
No 10, do you think he's guilty?

2063
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,200
Yes, I think he's guilty...

2064
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,000
...but I couldn't care less.

2065
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,000
You smart bastards...
you do whatever you want!

2066
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,600
How do you vote?

2067
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,300
I vote not guilty.

2068
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,900
Do whatever you want...

2069
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,600
You're the worst son of a...

2070
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,200
I think he's guilty!

2071
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,800
Does anyone else think he's guilty?

2072
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,600
No, I'm... I'm convinced...

2073
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,500
What's the matter with you?

2074
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,800
I now have... a reasonable doubt.

2075
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,000
It's eleven to one!

2076
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,700
What about all the other evidence?

2077
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,700
The knife... all that other
stuff... the whole business!

2078
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,000
You said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

2079
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,300
You're alone.

2080
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,000
I don't care whether I'm alone or not...

2081
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,100
- ... it's my right!
- It is your right.

2082
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
What do you want?

2083
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,300
I say he's guilty.

2084
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,600
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

2085
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,000
But we're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.

2086
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,100
We have as much time as it takes.

2087
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,100
Everything...

2088
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,800
...every single thing that
went on in that courtroom...

2089
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,100
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

2090
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,100
What do you think I am,
an idiot or something?

2091
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,200
You...

2092
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:21,100
...lousy bunch of bleeding hearts!

2093
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,000
Well, you're not going to intimidate me!

2094
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,300
I am entitled...

2095
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,600
...to my opinion!

2096
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,500
I can sit in this god
damn room for a year!

2097
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,800
Somebody say something...

2098
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:47,700
Look...

2099
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,900
...why don't you take
all that stuff about...

2100
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,300
...the old man, the old
man who lived there...

2101
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,300
...who heard everything...

2102
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:59,000
...or the knife... What, just
because he found one just like it?

2103
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,400
The old man saw him!

2104
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,400
On the stairs!

2105
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,700
What difference does it make how many
seconds it took, what is the difference?

2106
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,200
Every... single thing...

2107
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,200
That knife...

2108
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,800
...falling through a hole in his pocket!

2109
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,400
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door!

2110
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:28,000
Sure, you can hobble around here
all you want, but you can't prove it.

2111
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,100
I'm telling you...

2112
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:36,100
...every single thing... has
been twisted and turned in here!

2113
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:42,200
That business about the eyeglasses...
You don't know whether she wore glasses...

2114
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:46,100
The woman testified, god d...! In court!

2115
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,400
What do you want?

2116
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,400
That's it!

2117
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,100
This whole... case...

2118
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,800
...the whole thing about the boy...

2119
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,800
...yelling out...

2120
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,500
...the phrase was...

2121
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:15,000
..."I am going to kill you"...

2122
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,800
...and he said it to his own father!

2123
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,800
I don't care...

2124
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,100
...what kind of a man he was,

2125
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,500
it was his father!

2126
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,700
God damn rotten kid!

2127
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:38,000
I know what it's like, I know what
they can do, I know how they can...

2128
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,500
...kill you... every day!

2129
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,000
My god...

2130
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,400
...don't you see?

2131
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:53,000
Why am I the only one who sees?

2132
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,800
Jesus...

2133
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,500
I can feel the knife going in...

2134
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,800
He's not your boy...

2135
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,900
He's somebody else...

2136
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,600
Let him live.

2137
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,700
Alright...

2138
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,700
Not guilty.

2139
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,800
We've reached a verdict.

2140
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,400
Ok gentlemen, take your
seats in the jurybox.

2141
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,800
Excuse me...

2142
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,400
My name's McCardle.

2143
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,500
- What's yours?
- Davis.

2144
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,500
Well...

2145
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,900
So long...

2146
