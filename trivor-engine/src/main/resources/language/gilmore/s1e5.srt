1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,921
Previously on Gilmore Girls.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,840
- My God, I'm going to Chilton?
- You did it, babe. You got in.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,217
This guy asked about you today.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,509
- I'm Dean.
- Hi.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,803
- What did he want to know?
- Where you were.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,348
- What did you say?
- You had to go to the genius school.

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,515
I've been watching you.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,683
When?

9
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,893
Every day.

10
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,479
- I'm Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,148
I'm gonna miss the test!

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,775
- Go!
- I'm gone!

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,653
- What about the test?
- You've missed the test.

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,737
I'm ready for it.

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,572
I know everything about Shakespeare.

16
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,325
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

17
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,870
Rory told me that
she wasn't allowed to take her test.

18
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:37,955
She was late.

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,499
You say she's smart and she'll do fine.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,502
And this rotting, stodgy rathole
could use somebody like her.

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,171
Then you shut her out of a test
that she's crammed for...

22
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,548
that she completely deserves to take!

23
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,592
No. Harvard is my dream.

24
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,928
I want it more than anything. I swear.

25
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,888
I'm not ready to give up on Chilton yet.

26
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,682
It's Max Medina calling.

27
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,518
Lorelai, it was a pleasure
encountering you.

28
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,228
I hope it happens again.

29
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,479
Bye.

30
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,399
Where did you say Dad was?

31
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,276
- Away on business.
- Location's top-secret?

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,153
Germany.

33
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,490
- Is Dad's firm insuring Nazis?
- Your father doesn't know any Nazis.

34
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,993
- I know, Mom. I was just...
- What?

35
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,787
Joking. She was joking.

36
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,707
- Hard to tell.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Claudia died.

38
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,922
- Who?
- Claudia, your cousin.

39
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm hearing the name, Mom.
I have no idea who that is.

40
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,555
Claudia's your cousin,
for all intents and purposes.

41
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,889
Now we're getting to it.

42
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
She was your father's grandmother's
sister's girl.

43
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,519
- So, to you, that would make her...
- Nothing?

44
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,981
Regardless. Funeral's on Thursday.
I thought we'd all go together.

45
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,234
Two problems: One, impossible
to get away from the Inn on Thursday.

46
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,819
Two, I've never met this woman.

47
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,487
- You certainly have.
- When?

48
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,156
- Several times.
- I'll take one.

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,075
We went to her house in Groton
to see the first moon landing.

50
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,702
She'd just gotten a new Philco.

51
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,620
I have no memory of this whatsoever.

52
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,790
Rory, correct me if I'm wrong,
but men have walked on the moon...

53
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,876
regardless of whether
your mother remembers.

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,043
That's the rumor.

55
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,172
I know men have walked on the moon.
I just don't know Claudia.

56
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,132
- So you're not going?
- Not this time.

57
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,885
I don't think Claudia's planning to die
a second time.

58
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,763
- Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.
- Fine.

59
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,351
Wait, Rudolph Gottfried.

60
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,020
Another cousin?

61
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,690
No, a Nazi that we knew. I'd forgotten.
We stayed with him once in Munich.

62
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,609
Nice old man. Interesting stories.

63
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,112
Mom, you socialized with a known Nazi?

64
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,198
That's despicable. That's heinous.

65
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,366
No, dear, that was a joke.

66
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,852
I have an idea for a new reality show.

67
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,439
How about everyone just looks out
their kitchen window for a change?

68
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,941
She's cranky this morning.

69
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,194
Let's just say the world's
got a formidable opponent.

70
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,823
- Wait. Shouldn't you be baking?
- I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?

71
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,159
- Mom, the Chilton bake sale is today.
- I know. I got it covered.

72
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,328
- They expect things to be homemade...
- I know.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,122
...by someone other than Dolly Madison.

74
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,165
I said I have it covered.

75
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,170
All of the parents pitch in, so this
is really important. You know that, right?

76
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,840
I didn't know that.
In that case, I don't have it covered.

77
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,466
I have it covered.

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,178
- Get your stuff, hit the stereo. We're late.
- That's not me.

79
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,851
Where does your mom think you are?

80
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,397
On a park bench, contemplating
the reunification of the two Koreas.

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,190
Not here, skanking to Rancid?

82
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,484
- Wouldn't be included.
- School.

83
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,864
Bye.

84
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,326
Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
Yeah, Morey made it.

86
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:52,125
Cinnamon's not walking good these days,
but she still likes her passeggiatas.

87
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,879
- That's Italian for "a nice walk."
- Passeggiata.

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,424
- Oh, God, he makes it sound so sexy.
- Come on.

89
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,717
What's that?

90
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,721
That's Cinnamon's private area.
Sometimes she likes to be alone.

91
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,390
She's just like Morey in that sense.

92
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,101
Say "passeggiata" again.

93
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,562
I can't do it on command, Babs.

94
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,608
He's blushing.
God, I love a man that blushes.

95
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,196
- Okay, our town is just weird.
- Thank God.

96
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,947
Bye.

97
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,241
- I'll see you later at school.
- For what?

98
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,618
Mom, the bake sale.

99
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,412
- I got the vein in the forehead.
- Sadist.

100
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,824
- Morning.
- Good book?

101
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,618
I don't know yet.

102
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,163
I saw you standing in line,
so I thought I'd say hello.

103
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,457
- Hello?
- Hello.

104
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,045
Thanks for helping me
get the job at the store.

105
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,631
It's not a career or anything,
but it's got me solvent.

106
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,133
- Solvent is good.
- Yeah.

107
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,928
- Are you always this serious?
- No.

108
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,848
So, how long does it take you
to get to school?

109
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,685
Forty minutes if the bus driver's focused...

110
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,188
but longer if he's trying to win something
on the radio.

111
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,816
- This bus is going to Hartford.
- Yeah, I know.

112
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,194
But you go to school here.
You have to get off the bus.

113
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,697
- He has to get off the bus.
- Wait.

114
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,324
You're forgetting something.

115
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,076
Buses make stops.

116
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,371
Goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.

117
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,760
Independence Inn, Michel speaking.

118
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,055
Yes, you are confirmed.

119
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,516
Goodbye.

120
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,854
No, sorry.

121
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,275
Sir, I'm a simple country boy from Texas.

122
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,945
I do not understand this Francais business
you're babbling about.

123
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,196
Pardon.

124
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,453
- He knows you are not from Texas.
- Smile when you say that.

125
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,831
Michel, I told you there would
be a French group here for some days...

126
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,541
and it's your job to keep them happy.

127
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,627
I don't know how many French people
you've met over the years...

128
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,589
- but most of them are insufferable.
- Really?

129
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,924
That is why I left France.

130
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,220
I thought it had something to do
with the torches and the villagers.

131
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,473
- Michel, talk to them.
- Never.

132
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,143
You are giving me that look, aren't you?

133
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,439
Your patented "do it or something
unspeakable shall befall you" look.

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,027
Fine. I shall be French,
but I shall not be happy.

135
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,780
Then you will be yourself. Good choice.

136
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,255
Kill me now.

137
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,103
Okay, we've got our French fantasies...

138
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:46,359
American treats,
and our Italian taste sensations.

139
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,030
- What do you think?
- Amazing.

140
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,490
Incredible.

141
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,952
It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.

142
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
Can I do that?

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,627
Honey, this is a more delicate procedure
than you might think.

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,004
- Okay.
- It takes an expert hand.

145
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,180
Hi.

146
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,393
What is that, $1? Let me just give you...

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,728
Let me find you $1.

148
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,023
You know what? I'll take two.
I'll drink one.

149
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,319
Tasty and flame-retardant.

150
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,663
- Very Henry Vlll.
- We're not into subtle.

151
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,833
- Good to see you, Lorelai.
- Good to see you, Mr. Medina.

152
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,376
- Max.
- Mr. Medina.

153
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,920
Mr. Medina, meet Sookie,
the chef at the Inn.

154
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
- Sookie, Mr. Medina.
- What's the name again?

155
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,842
- Mr. Medina.
- I know, you've said it a zillion times.

156
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,051
Hello.

157
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,346
Lorelai, can I borrow you for a second?

158
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,889
Yeah, sure.

159
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,811
I'll be right back.

160
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,480
Trust me.

161
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,067
So?

162
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,070
You know, Lorelai,
I would love for the ice to thaw.

163
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,865
- There's no ice.
- You repeated my full name four times.

164
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,992
- That's ice.
- That's not ice. It's wintry.

165
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,745
I was doing my job
when I didn't let Rory take that test.

166
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,039
- I didn't like it, but I had to do it.
- I know.

167
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,832
- And I'd do it again.
- Okay.

168
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,876
I really do think Rory's a great kid...

169
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,546
and I'll do my damnedest to make sure
she gets through Chilton in one piece.

170
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,298
I appreciate that.

171
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,926
- And I'd like us to be friends.
- We are. Me, too.

172
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,264
- Yeah?
- Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice.

173
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,017
We're walking in a pool of tepid water.

174
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,894
Good.

175
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,274
I'm going to propose something here.
I'm not sure how you're gonna take it.

176
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,859
Wow, intrigue.

177
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,487
I'd like to see you sometime.

178
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,741
Away from the ivy,
away from the gargoyles, away from here.

179
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,079
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- Yes.

180
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,123
Well, I don't want to
go out on a limb here...

181
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,794
but if the headmaster won't let
a kid be 30 seconds late for a test...

182
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,630
he'd probably frown on
a teacher dating a mom.

183
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,007
I do my job well,
I'm dedicated to my students...

184
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,427
and there's nothing in
the Chilton Book of Ethics that prohibits it.

185
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,596
But I'm guessing
it's sort of an unwritten rule.

186
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,516
- Do you want to go?
- Rory would probably freak at the thought.

187
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,976
Other parents would have a field day
with this thing.

188
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,853
- Do you want to go?
- Yes.

189
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,896
- Good.
- Wait.

190
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,980
- What?
- No.

191
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,232
- Why?
- I can't.

192
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,858
- It's wrong. It's weird.
- I'll pay.

193
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,568
- You're on.
- Really?

194
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,947
I'm kidding. I don't know.
You're Rory's teacher.

195
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,156
I know.

196
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,493
Could you quit?
Right, that's crazy. I'm sorry.

197
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,120
Okay.

198
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,331
How about coffee? You like coffee?

199
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,792
Only with my oxygen.

200
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,128
Can we drink some together?
A sort of pre-date.

201
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,507
Very casual, no strings, no obligations.

202
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,011
We'll see if it's worth going down the road
of including food in the deal.

203
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,848
Just coffee.

204
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,976
Decaf?

205
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,980
There's nothing safer than decaf.

206
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,944
I'm gonna be in town tomorrow
because I take a class at Hartford State...

207
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,321
and there's a coffee shop
across the street...

208
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,992
that I sometimes, almost all the time,
go to around 4:00...

209
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,827
and usually exactly 4:12.

210
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,498
I could not stop a person from entering
said establishment around that time...

211
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,750
nor would I avoid them...

212
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,837
if I knew them, if they did.

213
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,633
You know, the wordsmith thing,
that's something we have in common.

214
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,344
So, see you around, Max.

215
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,763
Indeed. You will.

216
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,025
Philadelphia.

217
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,528
Philadelphia? If you could live
in any city in the world...

218
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,821
you'd pick Philadelphia?

219
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,490
- M. Night Shyamalan lives there.
- Who?

220
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,327
The guy who directed The Sixth Sense.

221
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,871
But what would you do there?

222
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,373
Hang out with M. Night Shyamalan.

223
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,502
Okay, cross "Guidance Counselor"
off your list of potential career choices.

224
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,339
Lie still, baby doll. We're almost home.

225
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
- Hey, Babbette.
- Hey, kids.

226
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,845
Wow, that sounds bad.

227
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:27,640
Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So is Morey.

228
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,142
- Too many clams.
- Bad clams.

229
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,686
This doesn't reflect well
on Al's establishment.

230
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,522
- You had clams at Al's?
- Al's Pancake World?

231
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,399
Yeah, we had a coupon.

232
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,367
Wow, the store.

233
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,621
- Listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so...
- What do you have to pick up?

234
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,664
Just some stuff.

235
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,459
So, I'll talk to you later tonight.

236
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,544
- I'll go in with you.
- Why?

237
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,797
Because, otherwise, I'd have to go home.

238
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,840
- Home is good.
- My home?

239
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,385
Actually, I don't have to go in.

240
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,929
Okay, then I guess I will go home.

241
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,014
Great. Go. Bye.

242
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,933
Bye. Freak.

243
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,003
Rory! Hello.

244
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:43,632
- Try a plum. They're better than sex.
- No, thanks.

245
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,595
Fresh fruit always has
such a sensuality about it.

246
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,099
- Are you too young for this?
- Definitely.

247
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,352
- What are you here for, honey?
- Well, I just...

248
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,397
I see what you're here for.

249
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,901
That wouldn't fit in a basket. No.

250
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,988
Patty, it's not like that. He's just a person.

251
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,198
- A person?
- A boy-type person.

252
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,201
- My favorite kind.
- I really don't even know him.

253
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,787
- Right. You don't know him?
- I don't.

254
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,081
- You said.
- Please don't say anything.

255
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:19,293
I promise I won't tell a soul
that you don't know that young man.

256
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

257
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,924
Ma'am, what are you doing?

258
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,678
Please, honey, don't call me ma'am.
It makes me feel older than 25.

259
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,555
Here, have a pea pod.

260
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:36,059
I'm assuming you'll pay for the food
that you've consumed on the premises.

261
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,686
So brusque.

262
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,148
- And you are?
- I'm the new assistant manager here.

263
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,568
Listen here, my fine friend,
who, if he had a better hairstyle...

264
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:47,738
I might consider dating.
I do this all the time.

265
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,698
Not from now on. I'm sorry.

266
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,869
Wait a minute. I've been sampling food
at this establishment for years.

267
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,830
If you put something in that mouth
that doesn't belong there...

268
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,249
I'll remove it and then call the police.

269
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,840
Is this all you want?
A head of lettuce and a mousetrap?

270
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:10,385
- That should do it.
- That's a couple of must-need items there.

271
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,723
- $2.27.
- I only have $1.

272
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,019
- I can loan you the rest.
- No, I'll just take the lettuce.

273
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,522
Perfect. You could use half of it
for a salad...

274
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,067
then use the other half
to clobber the mouse with.

275
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,277
- Paper or plastic?
- I'm fine.

276
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,720
- Lorelai?
- Max. Hi.

277
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,931
- Small world?
- Absolutely.

278
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,557
- What are you drinking?
- Coffee.

279
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,683
Plain coffee?

280
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,396
I wanted some cream, but that prompted
a very elaborate foam conversation.

281
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,649
The disapproval I got when I said
I didn't want foam, just cream...

282
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,735
rivaled the one from my dad
when I told him I wanted to teach.

283
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,571
Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you.

284
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,573
It's getting better.

285
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,159
- What can I get you?
- Coffee, please.

286
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,039
So, here we are.

287
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,209
- Here we most certainly are.
- Running into each other.

288
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,420
- Away from school.
- And its unique strictures.

289
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,339
- These things do happen.
- Fate can be funny.

290
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,383
Should we cut the cute and just get to it?

291
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,593
- I think we should date.
- Why?

292
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,639
- Because I think we both want to.
- I want to be in The Bangles.

293
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,892
It doesn't mean I quit my job
and get a guitar and ruin my life...

294
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,352
to be a Bangle. Does it?

295
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,563
- The Bangles broke up.
- That's not the point.

296
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,107
It's got to be part of it,
if there's no band anymore.

297
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,526
I repeat my question.
Why should we date?

298
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,945
Because we're clearly attracted
to each other.

299
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:56,241
I'm attracted to pie.
It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.

300
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,328
Okay, then,
because we are... of similar heights.

301
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,747
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.

302
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:07,169
Look, I know that you are concerned
about the appearance of us dating.

303
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,336
Yes, I am.

304
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,505
I can tell you I'm the soul of discretion...

305
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,633
when it comes to delicate relationships.

306
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,594
Dated a lot of Chilton moms?

307
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,346
No, I meant any relationship, work, family.

308
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,933
So you have things to hide
in all aspects of your life. Very interesting.

309
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,812
Do you have any hemlock back there?
Arsenic, something quick.

310
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,149
- Do you like rap music?
- Yeah.

311
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,358
Me, too.

312
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,402
- Italian food?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,695
Me, too.

314
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:35,655
- You telling me what I want to hear?
- Yeah.

315
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,740
I knew it.

316
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,992
Doesn't mean it doesn't coincide
with how I feel.

317
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:42,370
If you're telling what I wanna hear
then I'm not getting to know you.

318
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,582
If I know what you want to hear,
it shows my understanding of you...

319
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:48,084
far exceeds your understanding of me.

320
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,254
Who's the one lagging?

321
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,508
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.

322
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,638
Rory is my life. She's my pal.
My everything.

323
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,141
And I would never ever do anything
that would hurt her.

324
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,479
- But Rory is not a baby anymore.
- Don't say that.

325
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:11,524
She's eight, and her favorite hobby
is making necklaces out of gum wrappers.

326
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,277
You could try stunting her growth,
keeping her in a box...

327
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,655
blowing cigarette smoke on her.

328
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,367
You are so taking this out of context.

329
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:29,584
When my uncle was a young man...

330
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,546
there was this girl who lived
across the street from him...

331
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,883
and he was completely in love with her.
But he never talked to her.

332
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:41,012
He knew in his gut that this was the girl
he wanted to spend his life with.

333
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,472
This is gonna be sad, isn't it?

334
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,432
- Let me finish.
- It's gonna be sad.

335
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,559
So, anyhow, my uncle watches this girl...

336
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,728
waiting for the right moment
to approach her.

337
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,148
- Next thing he knows, he gets drafted.
- I'm going for the Kleenex.

338
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,402
Now, he thinks,
"This is perfect. I'll come back..."

339
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:59,364
"I'll have a career, I'll have served
my country. I'll be worthy of her love."

340
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,658
When he gets back, she's gone.

341
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,077
Moved away. No one knew where.

342
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,205
And he never saw that girl again.

343
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,625
Now, my uncle, he didn't say much to me.

344
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,586
But the one thing that he did say...

345
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,590
was that if there's something in your gut...

346
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,260
that you know you feel is right...

347
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:23,346
you got to go after it, no matter what.

348
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,932
What do you say?

349
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,821
Maybe dinner...

350
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:43,158
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

351
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:46,369
Dinner? You mean we could sit together,
even drive together?

352
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,122
- Just take the card.
- I might frame the card.

353
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,791
- Just use the card.
- I definitely will.

354
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:01,426
What?

355
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,889
That story about your uncle, is that true?

356
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:11,060
Goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.

357
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,655
Thank you.

358
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,159
Life is a funny thing, huh?

359
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,453
Yeah, I love that Jim Carrey.

360
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,663
- What?
- Jim Carrey.

361
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,833
- He's just funny.
- He is funny.

362
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,545
But then I don't mean funny-funny.
I'm being philosophical.

363
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,381
Very serious face. Jean Paul Sartre.

364
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,425
I can't talk to you with that face.

365
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:44,636
How do you guys get any work done?

366
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,639
So why is life such a funny thing?

367
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:51,100
- I met this amazing guy.
- Goody!

368
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,895
There's goody stuff about it,
but there's baddy stuff, too.

369
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,648
He teaches at Chilton. Max.
You met him at the bake sale.

370
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,232
- He looked good.
- Yeah. Right.

371
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:01,527
He's so sexy, smart, and funny,
and he likes coffee.

372
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,655
God, he sounds perfect for you.

373
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,031
- Did you get onions?
- No.

374
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,283
Luke, you forgot the onions.

375
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,079
I'm just so mixed up.
This is a real crossroads situation.

376
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:14,374
It's like: To perm or not to perm.
I'm really confused.

377
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,294
For heaven's sake!
Go ahead. I'm still listening.

378
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,130
You were about to perm your hair.

379
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,549
I just want to do the right thing.

380
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,386
- I don't see what the problem is.
- There are many problems.

381
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:29,389
First: I do not like to involve Rory
in my personal life.

382
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:31,057
I don't want her to deal with that.

383
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,935
I bring some guy home,
and he might not be the guy...

384
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:37,814
but then she gets all attached to him,
and then all of a sudden I decide...

385
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:41,234
that I don't like the way he eats,
or he hums incessantly...

386
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,112
Or the way he smacks his lips,
or how his hair isn't his own.

387
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:47,073
Then I break up with him,
and Rory is the one who gets hurt.

388
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,409
- I totally understand.
- This guy is her teacher.

389
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:52,203
I can't keep him out of her life.
She sees him every day.

390
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,747
- Are you the open-faced turkey?
- Yep.

391
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:57,834
I added a little fresh lemon
and a little cayenne pepper.

392
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,377
You're gonna plotz!

393
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,880
You do know
that Rory's not a baby anymore?

394
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,173
That's what he said.

395
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,719
Maybe I'm being too serious, right?
Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit.

396
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:10,972
- Plus, it would be great to get, you know.
- What?

397
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,767
- You know.
- No, I don't.

398
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,227
You know.

399
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,729
He knows.

400
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,689
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

401
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,775
- Sookie!
- I was looking for your paprika.

402
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,111
- What have I said about the counter?
- I know.

403
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,947
How the counter is a sacred space,
my sacred space.

404
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,866
You don't do yoga
on the Dalai Lama's mat.

405
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,285
And you don't come
behind my counter. Period!

406
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,870
I was trying to help!

407
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:37,373
You bring her again,
I want her on a leash! I mean it.

408
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,500
He does make a damn fine burger though.

409
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,835
He does at that.

410
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,588
All right. I'm just gonna keep it simple.
I'll tell Rory.

411
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:46,424
If there's even an ounce of weirdness
about it, I'll cancel.

412
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,593
- You haven't told Rory yet?
- No.

413
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:50,303
- Oops.
- No, not oops.

414
00:23:50,386 --> 00:23:55,099
The timing hasn't been right.
This is a very delicate, fragile situation.

415
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:58,311
It's like your souffles.
If you don't do it right, it's a disaster.

416
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:01,105
And you have to order it 45 minutes
in advance.

417
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,357
- My souffle.
- Right.

418
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,651
But I wasn't speaking directly
about your souffle.

419
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,904
I was speaking metaphorically.

420
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:11,157
- So you don't like my souffles?
- How do we work together?

421
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,492
Mom, you better come.

422
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,368
- Honey, what's wrong?
- It's Cinnamon.

423
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,638
- Babbette? Honey?
- Lorelai, come in.

424
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:37,892
She's gone.

425
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,354
- Cinnamon's gone.
- I'm so sorry.

426
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,148
Is there anything I can do for you, Morey?

427
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,943
This is life, Rory. It breaks your heart.

428
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:48,694
She looked like she was sleeping.

429
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,782
I thought she was asleep,
so I nudged her and she didn't wake.

430
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,326
I gave her a push
and she rolled off the couch...

431
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,205
and since I'd just waxed the floor,
she went shooting across the room.

432
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:02,250
And then she knocked over the lamp
and she still didn't move.

433
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,836
I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.

434
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:08,214
Tell me it wasn't the...

435
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:11,842
Morey, don't do this to yourself.
He thinks it was the clams.

436
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:15,888
She saw me eating them, and she gave me
that, "Hey, man, what's up?" look...

437
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,348
It wasn't the clams.

438
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,060
Morey, in human years,
this cat was 260 years old.

439
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:22,770
That's a good long life.

440
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,398
Listen, why don't you let me take her out
to the van?

441
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:28,484
- And then I'll get out of your way.
- No, stay.

442
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,571
All of you, please stay.
Cinnamon would want you here.

443
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,657
We'll stay as long as you want.

444
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,868
- I'll never eat clams again.
- Me either.

445
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,802
They said that they rolled her body
into a lamp?

446
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:57,722
Did you laugh?

447
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:00,558
Did you want to?

448
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,394
- But it's sad.
- Yeah, it's sad.

449
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,231
Hello?

450
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:11,152
Hello, where is Lorelai?
I'm dropping something off.

451
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,405
Yoo-hoo, heehaw man,
where's Lorelai Gilmore?

452
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,950
Thank you. I could not get back to the Inn.

453
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,454
What? You are having a party,
and I was not invited?

454
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,081
Sweetie, it's not a party. It's a wake.

455
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,209
- Really? Who died?
- Their cat.

456
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:32,006
- You are mourning a cat?
- Yes.

457
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:35,009
They lick their privates, these cats.

458
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,136
Not the comforting chit-chat
we're looking for.

459
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:39,221
Goodbye. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.

460
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:43,142
Babbette, Morey,
I came as soon as I heard.

461
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:48,105
- Darling, what do you need?
- A little air, honey.

462
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,527
- What you got in the bag?
- Bricks.

463
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,113
- Yeah, good one.
- Bless you both!

464
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,616
Everyone's starved. Come in.

465
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,417
Okay, how should we do this?

466
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,212
We'll create a flow through the room
to avoid bottlenecks.

467
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,797
People coming in the front door
will want a beverage.

468
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,092
Put them on the first table,
then the hors d'oeuvres next to that...

469
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:19,220
leaving one hand free to greet the people.

470
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,180
Then, back there,
set up plates and cutlery.

471
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:24,308
First the salads, then the meat,
then the desserts on the bench.

472
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,393
- How's that sound?
- Dig in!

473
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,746
- I wasn't expecting you.
- Or me you. I mean, you me.

474
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,165
I mean, come on in, you.

475
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:55,464
- Do you know him?
- No.

476
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:56,924
No?

477
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:00,761
He goes to my old school,
so I see him there sometimes...

478
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:04,014
- but I go to Chilton now.
- Thanks for the update.

479
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,017
You're welcome.

480
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:12,231
- Do you have a second?
- No, I have gum.

481
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:16,026
- No, thanks. Look...
- I have to get back.

482
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,696
Okay, sure.

483
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,240
I'll see you later.

484
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,167
Mom?

485
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:36,297
- Isn't that...
- No!

486
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,384
- That's Mr. Medina.
- Tonight's Thursday.

487
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:42,052
Am I in trouble?

488
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:45,222
- Did the school call or something?
- No, you're great.

489
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:48,267
Let me just come back in just one second.

490
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,728
- Wait, what's going on?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

491
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:53,105
- Tell me now.
- Max is here.

492
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:55,733
- Max?
- Max is here to pick me up.

493
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,776
Pick you up for...

494
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:03,574
I'm gonna talk to him real quick,
and I'm gonna be right back.

495
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,249
I was knocking, but no one answered.

496
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,585
I know. I was at the neighbors' house.

497
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,962
Max, I should have called you sooner, but...

498
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,257
- You're canceling.
- I know it's totally last-minute.

499
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,343
- I'm heartbroken.
- I completely forgot about our date.

500
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,637
- And forgettable.
- No, you're memorable.

501
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,557
I've been memorabling you all week.

502
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,101
It's just, we had a little emergency.

503
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,813
- Rory? Is Rory okay?
- Rory's fine. It's the neighbors' cat.

504
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,983
- The neighbors'...
- Cat, she died.

505
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:43,447
- She died.
- This was a very fat, very beloved cat.

506
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,115
I see.

507
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:51,789
I like you.

508
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,501
And I don't want to force
something on you that you don't want.

509
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:00,839
No. Wait.
Max, you're not forcing anything on me.

510
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,966
I am telling the truth about the cat.

511
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,136
Max, please don't read that much
into this.

512
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:10,766
Call me, and we'll reschedule.
I promise that's what I want.

513
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,520
Are you sure?

514
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:18,982
Cross my heart and hope that no other
neighborhood pets die on that day.

515
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,485
Okay, I'll call.

516
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,196
Good.

517
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,950
- I'm sorry about...
- Cinnamon.

518
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:46,843
Stupid cat!
Couldn't have held on one more day?

519
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,182
- Is that meatloaf?
- Yeah.

520
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,475
You use ketchup?

521
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,894
- You gonna make fun of my mother, too?
- Sorry.

522
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:58,814
My Roquefort puffs
would complement that dish quite well.

523
00:30:58,897 --> 00:31:01,608
- It's fine on its own. Thank you.
- Right.

524
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,529
Okay, toss some on the plate.

525
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:08,490
Can I make a pretty design?
Maybe make some layers?

526
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:11,159
Right. Tossing them on. Got it.

527
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,120
Have you guys seen Rory anywhere?

528
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:16,039
- Yeah, I think she headed that way.
- Okay, thanks.

529
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,046
Excuse me, ma'am?

530
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,674
Well, if it isn't Kirk the Jerk.

531
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:29,052
I want to apologize for what happened
at the store yesterday.

532
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:30,262
I'm listening.

533
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:32,389
I wasn't aware you were the Miss Patty.

534
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,225
The owner tells me
you're one of our best customers...

535
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:38,103
and that you can put anything
in that mouth that you want.

536
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,397
Those were his words.
I could have paraphrased.

537
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,234
Stop sweating and close your pores, Kirky.
I always forgive.

538
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,278
- Thank you.
- Once.

539
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,701
- Babbette.
- Hello, sugar.

540
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,038
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.

541
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:59,124
- I think she might be in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

542
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,918
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

543
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,005
I thought I'd just get
some of this stuff packed away.

544
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:08,884
It's like a scene from the kitty version
of Valley of the Dolls.

545
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:12,262
Yeah, you never realize
how old they actually are...

546
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,890
till you look in the medicine cabinet.

547
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:17,768
These were for her heartworms.

548
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:20,729
For her thyroid, her kidneys...

549
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:23,482
for the rash she got from taking these...

550
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:28,070
and these were for the tics she developed
from taking the stuff for the rash.

551
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:31,073
And these are... These are mine.

552
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,659
Damn. I'm gonna miss that old broad.

553
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,328
I know.

554
00:32:36,661 --> 00:32:40,123
You know, I don't know
what I'm gonna do with myself now.

555
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:42,209
You live to take care of your kids.

556
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:45,253
I know, sweetie,
but you gave her everything you had.

557
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:49,800
She was so tiny when I got her,
she could sleep in my shoe.

558
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:54,638
The other day,
I came across a hat that I made for Rory.

559
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,766
- It was like a doll hat.
- They grow up so fast.

560
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,559
And then they take your clothes.

561
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,270
I guess, eventually, you have to move on.

562
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:04,689
Figure out what your life is gonna be...

563
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:08,109
when you're not busy
taking care of somebody else.

564
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:15,242
Jeez, look at this place.
Not a clean glass in sight.

565
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,828
Let me help you with that.

566
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,835
Here, sugar, use this.

567
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:27,337
Morey sits on it when he helps me.

568
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:33,134
- How does Morey get around in here?
- Just fine.

569
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:36,221
He had a couple of concussions
his first year here.

570
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,181
But he never complains.

571
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:40,851
He's just the best thing.

572
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,104
Don't know what I'd do without him.

573
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,527
What do you mean without him?

574
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:53,738
I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago...

575
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:56,700
she had on couples who lost a child.

576
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:00,954
Most of the marriages went belly up
for the pain of it all.

577
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:02,831
Even though they loved each other.

578
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:05,458
Babbette, that is not gonna happen to you.

579
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,545
I never thought
a man would ever even want me.

580
00:34:08,628 --> 00:34:09,838
I know the feeling.

581
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,591
Please, with that ass? Give me a break.

582
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,885
I mean, want me for more than my ass.

583
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,430
For me. The whole package.

584
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:21,433
- Annoying neuroses and all.
- You'll find him.

585
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:26,021
It might even be that stud
that drove out of here in that Mustang.

586
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,440
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

587
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:31,109
- What a jaw.
- Right. He's got a great jaw.

588
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:34,821
- How is he in the sack?
- I haven't gone out with him yet.

589
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,198
Will you tell me how he is when you do?

590
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:39,617
I'll call you during the cigarette.

591
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,959
That's Cinnamon's song.

592
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:20,200
- I can't find Rory anywhere.
- I'm sure she's around.

593
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,994
Max showed up for the date
I forgot about, and she saw him.

594
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:24,537
- You haven't told her.
- No.

595
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,122
- Oops.
- Stop with the oops.

596
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,958
Okay, calm down.
It's not that big of a deal.

597
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,795
Her teacher showed up on her porch
to take out her mother.

598
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:34,255
She'll understand.
You're crazy. She knows that.

599
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:37,133
- Enough of the comforting, Sookie.
- Sorry.

600
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,061
Jeez, you scared me.

601
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:51,439
Yeah, look,
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

602
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:55,026
- For what?
- I've been kind of bugging you lately.

603
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,948
I thought you maybe liked me,
but it's obvious that you're not interested.

604
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:02,450
So I just wanted to say that I get it.

605
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:05,120
And I'm not gonna bother you anymore.

606
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,128
Wait!

607
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,340
I am interested.

608
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:20,510
- You are?
- Yes.

609
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,137
I got to go.

610
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:33,898
Finally. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

611
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:36,359
- You found me.
- I have some explaining to do.

612
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:39,946
So sit down in that tiny chair.
I'm gonna do it right now.

613
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:43,533
That man on the porch was your teacher.

614
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:47,495
Mom, I'm a little behind in school...

615
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,874
but not so behind that I don't know
who the teacher is. So?

616
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,253
He and I were going to
sort of hang out together.

617
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,713
- On a date.
- No.

618
00:36:56,796 --> 00:37:00,133
On something that could appear
like a date to the untrained eye.

619
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:02,176
- And to your daughter's eye?
- It was a date.

620
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:05,555
- How long have you been dating him?
- This was gonna be the first time.

621
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:08,349
When were you planning to tell me?
On your wedding?

622
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:10,518
No, by the rehearsal dinner at least.

623
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:13,021
- He's my teacher.
- I know.

624
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,107
He teaches me things every day...

625
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,443
in a small classroom
with a lot of other kids...

626
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:21,112
who won't be high-fiving me
when they find this out.

627
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:24,657
I know. I told him this was
one of the things I was concerned about.

628
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,826
- And?
- And he thought we could be discreet.

629
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,411
- Unbelievable!
- Are you mad?

630
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:29,871
- Yes.
- Right.

631
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,415
- Because I'm dating him?
- Because you lied to me.

632
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:35,543
- I kept information from you.
- Information that I should have had.

633
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:38,463
It would've come out eventually
like the Iran-Contra Scandal.

634
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:40,590
- So you're Oliver North.
- No, I'm Fawn Hall.

635
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:42,717
- Mom.
- She was much prettier.

636
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:47,639
I can't believe that you didn't tell me
about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?

637
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:51,225
'Cause I thought you were going to
take it bad. Thank God I was wrong.

638
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:55,438
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry.
I won't date him. I promise.

639
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:58,274
I'm not saying that you can't date him.

640
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,651
It's just... This is weird.

641
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,696
I mean, there are a million guys
in this world...

642
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,365
and you end up with Mr. Medina.

643
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,408
You think I don't get the weirdness factor?

644
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:10,787
Believe me, the last thing I intended to do
was date your teacher.

645
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:14,457
- I believe you.
- I really like him, Rory. I can't help it.

646
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:17,085
It's been a long time
since I've felt like this.

647
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,420
You can't always control
who you're attracted to.

648
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:22,673
The Angelina Jolie-Billy Bob Thornton
thing really proves that.

649
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,635
I know you don't understand this now,
but you will someday.

650
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:28,846
You'll meet some great guy,
and he'll make your head all foggy...

651
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,140
and you won't know
what to do with yourself.

652
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:34,602
Sweetie, I won't keep anything
from you again. Okay? I promise.

653
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:38,106
From now on, every aspect of my life
is an open book to you.

654
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,108
- It's okay.
- Really.

655
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:45,071
I'm not even gonna get dressed until
I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.

656
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,948
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

657
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:49,325
Tomorrow, I'm thinking...

658
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:53,287
the purple tiger top, the black leather
skirt, the panda-bear underwear?

659
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:54,831
Good.

660
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:57,583
But of course
I'm totally open to suggestions.

661
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,669
Here's one: Get some help.

662
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:08,344
- Let us know if we can do anything.
- You've done too much already.

663
00:39:10,054 --> 00:39:12,014
- Good night, Babbette.
- Good night, sugar.

664
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:14,642
- Good night, Morey.
- Stay cool, Rory.

665
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,068
It's getting late.

666
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:26,654
Let's stay outside awhile, baby.

667
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:32,076
- Look for the Big Dipper.
- Okay, I'd like that.

668
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:56,684
- Hello.
- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

669
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:58,227
- Mom?
- Yes.

670
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:01,397
- You already said that.
- But someone hasn't.

671
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:03,024
Hello.

672
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:05,443
- There we go.
- You are impossible to reach.

673
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:07,320
There's no messages on the machine.

674
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:08,654
I don't leave messages.

675
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:12,033
If I wanted to talk to a machine,
I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?

676
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:13,659
- At a wake.
- A what?

677
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,453
A wake. A funeral.

678
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:18,372
- A funeral? Whose?
- It was for the neighbors'...

679
00:40:18,664 --> 00:40:19,707
cat.

680
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:27,256
Hold on. I'm looking up "aneurysm" in our
medical dictionary to see if I just had one.

681
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:30,051
I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom.
Silly me.

682
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:32,428
- A cat?
- Yeah, it was a cat's funeral.

683
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:36,057
You skipped your own cousin's funeral
for a cat funeral?

684
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,435
Not my cousin. My father's grandmother's
sister's girl who I never...

685
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:41,270
You said you can't be away from the Inn.

686
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:44,523
- I couldn't at the time, but I worked it out.
- For a cat.

687
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:47,234
It's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.

688
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,612
What? You're going to
a raccoon's wedding?

689
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,947
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night.

690
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,453
She's working
for a sedative manufacturer.

691
00:40:57,536 --> 00:40:59,330
Keeping that demand sky-high.

692
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,915
You shouldn't have told her.

693
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,751
I don't know what to tell and what to hide.

694
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:10,716
So, we never did quite settle
the whole dating-your-teacher issue.

695
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,512
I won't go out with him
if you don't want me to.

696
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,972
You can go out with whoever you want.

697
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,557
It's whoever we want.

698
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:22,061
I'm certainly not gonna go out with him
'cause that'd be really weird.

699
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:25,481
But I mean it.
I won't see him if you don't want me to.

700
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:30,903
If there's anything that makes you
feel uncomfortable, big or small...

701
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:33,614
- then he's out of there.
- Good to know.

702
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,534
Because, you know,
it's not like I'm desperate.

703
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,953
I mean, there are plenty
of other guys out there.

704
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:40,287
Sure are.

705
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:44,125
And it's not like
I have to ask your permission.

706
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,710
- I mean, this is a courtesy.
- Okay.

707
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:55,344
I'm gonna be up for a while
if you want to get back to me on this.

708
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,430
I know where you are.

709
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:06,063
Think you could keep him out late
on Thursday night?

710
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:10,025
I have this oral exam on Friday
that I'd really love him to sleep through.

711
00:42:10,067 --> 00:42:11,652
I'll do my best.
