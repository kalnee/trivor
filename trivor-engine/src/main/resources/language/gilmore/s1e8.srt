1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,368
This town meeting will come to order.

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:07,704
- No one is listening to me.
- Taylor, calm down.

3
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:09,872
I can't calm down. I'm being persecuted.

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,333
- I promised that we'd hear you.
- We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.

5
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,086
Excuse me, but some of us
have businesses to run...

6
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:19,130
that don't involve
peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:20,673
It was a lava lamp, Taylor.

8
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:23,550
There is no use for a lava lamp
unless you're on drugs.

9
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,302
For crying out loud.

10
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:28,972
Now, we've already agreed
to look into your accusation but to just...

11
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,223
What'd I miss?

12
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:33,767
Taylor Doose wants the no-parking zone
in front of his store removed.

13
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,186
He says his customers
are being unfairly ticketed.

14
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:39,231
- No, he just wants to park there all day.
- Genius.

15
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:42,483
I have been mayor of this fine town
for a long time.

16
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,486
I tend to think of all of you as my children.

17
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:49,322
Unfortunately, sometimes children
have to be disciplined.

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,534
Now, I'm gonna say something,
and I'm only gonna say it once.

19
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:56,287
We have leash laws, people.

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,538
Daddy's getting angry.

21
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,832
- Rover will not leash himself.
- Good point.

22
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:05,419
I would like to now move on
to something of even greater importance.

23
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,463
As you all know, this coming Friday...

24
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:12,801
is the anniversary of
the legendary Battle of Stars Hollow.

25
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:17,387
- Where's Luke?
- There.

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,014
Patty will be circulating a sign-up sheet...

27
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:22,350
for those of you
who would like to participate...

28
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,394
in the reenactment of the aforesaid battle.

29
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:27,229
He's turning red.

30
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,605
All right.

31
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:33,192
"It was a frigid November night
some 224 years ago..."

32
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,861
He's shifting in his seat.

33
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:37,404
"...Hollow Militia
stood in wait for the redcoats."

34
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,738
He's adjusting the cap.

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,492
"Tired and hungry, 12 proud men
took their positions in the town square."

36
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:45,411
He's fighting the urge.

37
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,788
"...and imminent death
in their valiant efforts..."

38
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:50,873
For God's sake, do we have to
go through this every damn year?

39
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:52,917
- Yes!
- And the urge wins by a long shot.

40
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,628
I thought we were here
to discuss town issues.

41
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,213
This is a town issue.

42
00:01:57,296 --> 00:02:00,132
- Excuse me, who's talking?
- It's me, Harry. Luke.

43
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:02,509
You've known me
since I was five years old.

44
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:05,260
Luke, yes. Sit down.

45
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:09,348
Now, as I was saying: "12 heroic men..."

46
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:13,101
"assembled with guns drawn,
ready to meet their maker..."

47
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:16,937
What are you talking about?
Twelve guys stood in a row all night.

48
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,314
- "...waiting for the redcoats..."
- Who never showed!

49
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:20,523
Now, just...

50
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,943
Twelve guys stood in a row
waiting for an enemy that never showed.

51
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:27,279
They got stood up. They should've
been wearing prom dresses.

52
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:30,448
- I've had just about enough of this.
- Sit down, Taylor!

53
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:31,783
- Menace.
- Suck up.

54
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:33,951
- $5, someone ends up in a headlock.
- You're on.

55
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:37,705
Have any of you considered the fact
that you're glorifying a war we fought...

56
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,831
so we could keep land that we stole?

57
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:41,917
If you don't like it here in America...

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,712
why don't you go stand in line
for toilet paper in the USSR?

59
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,464
There is no more USSR, Harry.

60
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,800
A sense of community
is so important, isn't it?

61
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,428
It's what made our country great.

62
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,680
...if you're so interested in facts.

63
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:35,177
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

64
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:37,763
And once again we miss each other.

65
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,474
It's now 2.;00 in the afternoon
on Thursday...

66
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,684
and I'm in my office
grading a paper entitled. ;

67
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,519
Emily Dickinson, Get a Life.

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,356
Anyhow, as I sit here
losing my faith in mankind...

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,399
I wonder if we're ever gonna
actually go on that date...

70
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,025
we talked about many moons ago.

71
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,861
I teach a night class in Stamford
twice a week...

72
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:59,198
and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign
on the turnpike, I think. ;

73
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:03,869
"Out there is a beautiful woman
that I someday hope to spend time with."

74
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:07,580
Anyhow, I'm just thinking about you.

75
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,708
I don't know, maybe next week
we can find some time.

76
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,750
Bye, Lorelai Gilmore.

77
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,836
You knew that. Okay, bye.

78
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:20,799
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

79
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,217
- Mom?
- And once again we miss each other.

80
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,511
- Sorry.
- What are you doing up?

81
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:28,430
- I couldn't sleep.
- It's freezing in here.

82
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,767
Wait. Close your eyes and breathe.

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,062
I smell snow.

84
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,856
- It's that time of year.
- Can't you smell it?

85
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,692
You know, it's like dogs
and high-pitched noises.

86
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,445
I think it's something only you can smell.

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,157
- I love snow.
- Really? I had no idea.

88
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:55,077
Everything's magical when it snows.
Everything looks pretty.

89
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:59,498
The clothes are great:
Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.

90
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,584
Thermal underwear, wool socks, earflaps.

91
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,878
Do you know the best things in my life
have happened when it snowed?

92
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,588
Why, yes, I do.

93
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,798
- My best birthday.
- Your first kiss.

94
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,175
Your first steps.
They all happened when it snowed.

95
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,343
Feet.

96
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,056
- I feel good. Tingly.
- That's called frostbite.

97
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:22,183
You are mocking your mother,
the woman who birthed you.

98
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:24,894
- I'm sorry.
- During a snowstorm, might I add.

99
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,937
So how soon is it supposed to hit?

100
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,441
Tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow.

101
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,318
- Okay, then tomorrow it is.
- What?

102
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:37,196
You, me, doughnuts, coffee,
standing out in a snowstorm.

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,864
- At midnight?
- At midnight.

104
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,115
You are my favorite daughter.

105
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,661
How many times
are you gonna listen to that?

106
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:46,454
Till it stops being sexy.

107
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,040
Stop. That's my teacher
you're talking about.

108
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:50,374
I have to respect him.

109
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,792
Okay, if it makes you feel any better...

110
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:56,462
while he's being sexy,
he's also being grammatically correct.

111
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,714
Better. Thank you.

112
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,257
Sorry, I woke you up.

113
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:03,134
It's okay. It's all fodder for the tell-all.

114
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:04,677
Good night.

115
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:19,690
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

116
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,109
How is it out there?

117
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,028
It is cold and gray, like a fat, dead pigeon.

118
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,405
We'll pull out the sleds.
People might want to sled.

119
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,948
We'll need the parkas.

120
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,825
- For what?
- In case anyone wants to hike.

121
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,121
You know not everyone finds the idea of
being pelted with frozen water appealing.

122
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:38,206
I know, and how sad for them.

123
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,540
The sensation of getting lost
in a blizzard...

124
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:44,503
of freezing to death in the woods, eating
your friend's buttocks to stay alive...

125
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,379
That is lost on many people.

126
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:49,423
I am telling you,
five minutes in a snowball fight...

127
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:52,342
we could knock that stick
right out of your butt.

128
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,926
Okay, how does this sound?

129
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,429
Maple-sugar snowflakes
on all the pillows?

130
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:58,138
That sounds wonderful!

131
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:01,725
Make them in the shape of a buttock
to get people used to them.

132
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:05,186
- Is that a real suggestion?
- Sookie, please, who is speaking?

133
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:07,855
Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is.

134
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,024
I just can't believe it.

135
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,859
I mean, I sat next to him in practice
for months...

136
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:16,529
and then one day I look over, and it's Rich.

137
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,655
Rich Bloomenfeld.

138
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,824
Where is my chemistry book?
I had it at your house yesterday.

139
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,243
Rory, focus, please.

140
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:26,329
- I'm sorry. I just can't find my book.
- Hey, babe.

141
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:28,539
- Sergeant Pepper.
- Mom, do you know where my...

142
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:30,415
Scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.

143
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:31,708
Thank God.

144
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,507
- So, is Sookie in the kitchen?
- And there she'll stay.

145
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,468
- Okay. So, where were we?
- I just met my soul mate.

146
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,887
Right. Rich Bloomenfeld.

147
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:49,473
Does he still wear the Star Trek shirt?

148
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,809
Remember, you do not
take your eyes off this for a minute.

149
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,770
'Cause the second you do, it will boil,
and then it's ruined.

150
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:59,023
So just stand there and stare at it, okay?

151
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:03,151
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey, kitty-cats.

152
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,527
Cinnamon buns are over there.

153
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,071
Do you have any Rocky Road cookies
you made yesterday?

154
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,489
I can scrounge some up.

155
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:11,158
- Lane, you need a bag?
- No, thank you.

156
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,701
- Are you staring?
- I'm staring.

157
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,077
Thank you.

158
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,330
So, anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.

159
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,707
- Really?
- Oh, my God. It's so perfect.

160
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,835
It's thick, but it's not too thick,
and it's got really good natural wave.

161
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,296
So he probably uses way less product
than most guys.

162
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,630
Always a plus.

163
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:30,090
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

164
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,717
I have to get to the bus stop.
Dean's meeting me there.

165
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,928
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- I know. We'll talk on the way.

166
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,305
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Sookie.

167
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,601
A locksmith's coming to the house today,
like 5:00, and it could take long.

168
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,728
So tell Grandma and Grandpa I'll be late...

169
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:47,480
and that I'm having Satan's baby?
You pick the order.

170
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:50,357
I'll relay the time message
but I'm leaving the rest to you.

171
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,734
- You hate Rocky Road cookies.
- I do not.

172
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:56,153
I'm sorry. That must be
my other daughter, Shmory.

173
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:58,447
- We're leaving now.
- Wait a minute.

174
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:01,617
I know who likes Rocky Road cookies.

175
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,743
- Who?
- They're for Dean.

176
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:07,204
She's bringing baked goods
to a boy. Wow, serious.

177
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,624
Here, Dean, these cookies are for you,
because you're keen.

178
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,750
- Stop.
- Rory's in love!

179
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,135
- We can stop. She's gone now.
- But it's fun.

180
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:24,469
You're on your own.

181
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,432
I just can't believe it.

182
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,642
I've known him since the sixth grade,
but suddenly he's different.

183
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:36,646
He's not gangly anymore.
You remember how gangly he was?

184
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:38,856
I'm sorry. What?

185
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,650
- You're not listening to me.
- I am. I'm sorry.

186
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,527
I just couldn't find my bookmark.
Okay, go ahead.

187
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,781
Here are the problems facing
the whole Bloomenfeld-Kim situation.

188
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,116
One: Hyphenation would be a pain.

189
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:55,328
Two: He's my band partner.
Romance would be completely awkward.

190
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,831
Three: He's never even looked at me like
I'm a girl or something resembling one.

191
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,876
Four: There's no way I could
convince my parents he was Korean.

192
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,961
But I can't help it. I'm obsessed.

193
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:08,339
- Did I tell you about his hair?
- It's on his head, right?

194
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,468
Nice hat.

195
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:18,306
- Here.
- How'd you like it?

196
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,058
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

197
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:24,561
You liked it. You liked Jane Austen.
I knew you would.

198
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,646
- Lane, Dean likes Jane Austen.
- Who would've thought?

199
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,565
I told him he would, but he was all:

200
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,817
"Forget Jane Austen.
Read Hunter Thompson."

201
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,693
You do have to read Hunter Thompson.

202
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,404
Not as much as
you needed to read Jane Austen.

203
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,989
- What's that?
- Just some cookies.

204
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,867
- Rocky Road.
- Yeah.

205
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,036
Wow, she brings me cookies.
How can I repay her?

206
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,663
- How about Charlotte Bronte?
- How about something else?

207
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,336
That's good, too.

208
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,005
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for homeroom.

209
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,632
I have that perfect-attendance certificate
in my sights.

210
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:01,926
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you.

211
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,889
Ladies and gentlemen, we have flakes.

212
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:12,642
Flakes have been sighted.
Flakeage, if you will, has begun.

213
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:16,396
Michel, it's the first snowfall
of the season.

214
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,189
- It's very lucky. Make a wish.
- Get away from me.

215
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,901
You're not supposed to say it out loud.

216
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,779
- Independence Inn.
- The world changes when it snows.

217
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,199
It gets quiet. Everything softens.

218
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,036
- It's your mother.
- And then the rain comes.

219
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,455
Hi, Mom.

220
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,415
- Have you seen the news?
- Ever?

221
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:42,083
A bad storm's heading your way.
It's already hit us here.

222
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,253
I'll get the ark, you get the animals.

223
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,921
I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school.

224
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,215
The roads are terrible.
Black ice everywhere.

225
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,967
It's just a mess out there.
I hate this kind of weather.

226
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,427
What time will you get here?

227
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:54,969
I don't know, let's see.

228
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,431
Black ice, treacherous roads.
I'll wear my red-white-and-blue leotard...

229
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:00,766
grab my golden lasso,
and fly the invisible plane.

230
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:02,101
You're not coming.

231
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,936
If it's as bad as you say it is,
I don't see how I'd come.

232
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,772
- I guess it'll just be the three of us then.
- I guess so.

233
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,817
You know, Rory should probably
spend the night tonight also.

234
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,776
- Okay.
- And if it's still bad tomorrow...

235
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,861
Why don't you see
what the weather does...

236
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:17,780
before filling out
a change-of-address card for her.

237
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:19,323
- Rory's here.
- Put her on a sec.

238
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:21,158
Rory, it's your mother.

239
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,453
- Things bad out there?
- It's crazy.

240
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:27,163
There's snow coming down everywhere...

241
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,957
and saddle shoes
are not the best all-weather footwear.

242
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,792
- You fell.
- Twice.

243
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:35,461
- Yikes. I'm sorry.
- So, are you coming over tonight?

244
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,838
No, I'm pretty much stuck
in the Hollow tonight.

245
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:40,299
Bummer. We can take our snow walk
tomorrow night?

246
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:41,425
Absolutely.

247
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:44,511
Tell Grandma you arrived there
not a member of the Junior League.

248
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,388
I'd like you to leave there the same way.

249
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:49,056
- Call if you get Ionely.
- I will. Bye.

250
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:59,023
Stop this before somebody
drives through town...

251
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,109
and thinks the local mental institution
has bad padlocks.

252
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:06,321
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Your father was a reenactor.

253
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,656
Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.

254
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,201
- Who's stepping on my musket?
- That'd be me.

255
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,702
Well, stop it.

256
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,709
There goes the fire chief, the police chief...

257
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:26,046
and the one paramedic
with a valid license. I feel safe. Don't you?

258
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,297
Look at them.
All relatively intelligent men...

259
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:31,050
but there they are,
dressed up in costumes...

260
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,636
standing out in a snowstorm,
and for what?

261
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,013
Because it's tradition.

262
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:39,557
Tradition is a trap allowing people
to stick their head in the sand.

263
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:42,476
Everything in the past was so quaint,
so charming.

264
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,895
Times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex.

265
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,730
Neighbors knew each other.
It's a freaking fairy tale.

266
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:50,566
Things sucked then, too.
It sucked without indoor plumbing.

267
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:53,026
I think some traditions are nice.

268
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:54,903
Birthdays, holidays...

269
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,280
taking a walk
in the first snow of the season.

270
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,616
I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.

271
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,326
When I was five,
I had a really bad ear infection...

272
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,620
and I had been home in bed for a week,
and I was very sad.

273
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,374
So I wished really hard that something
wonderful would happen to me.

274
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,960
I woke up the next morning,
and it had snowed.

275
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:16,671
And I was sure that some fairy godmother
had done it just for me.

276
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,172
It was my little present.

277
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,549
Your parents didn't explain
the concept of weather?

278
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:24,094
I am making a point, Mouthy McGee.
Of course, many years later...

279
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:28,389
I realized that, logically,
the snow was not there for me personally.

280
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:32,393
But still, when it snows,
something inside me says:

281
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:37,188
"Hey, that's your present."
I don't think it'll ever change.

282
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,651
- My father used to be one of those guys.
- Yeah?

283
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,404
- Yeah, he even had his own musket.
- Really?

284
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,239
Never had to rent it.

285
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,158
- Where's the musket now?
- He was buried with it.

286
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,701
Yeah, he loved that musket.

287
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,329
That's nice, in a disturbing sort of way.

288
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:02,001
Come on in. I'll get you some coffee.

289
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,335
No, thanks.

290
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:06,588
I'm gonna walk around.
Enjoy my present a little.

291
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:17,472
People, please get into formation.

292
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,766
Hats on and instruments in place.

293
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,977
Do not, I repeat...

294
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,647
do not actually put instruments
to your mouths...

295
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,857
until we are inside.

296
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:32,235
Remember what happened
to the flautist last year.

297
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,604
I smell snow.

298
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,534
- What's up, Teach?
- What are you doing here?

299
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,203
I live here. What are you doing here?

300
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,288
I was on my way back from Stamford.
My car decided to stop.

301
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,498
- Here?
- Yes.

302
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,791
- In my town?
- Yes.

303
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:41,125
Good car.

304
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,585
- It's nice to see you.
- You, too.

305
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:47,214
You know, a minute ago
I was really angry about something...

306
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,507
and now I just can't remember
what it was.

307
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,009
- That's snow for you.
- I guess so.

308
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,095
So, this is quite a predicament you're in.

309
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:58,473
Stranded here in a strange town
with no one you know.

310
00:17:58,515 --> 00:17:59,640
Wait.

311
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,810
- Where's Rory tonight?
- She's in Hartford with her grandparents.

312
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,686
- That must be nice.
- Whatever you say.

313
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,688
- So Rory's in Hartford?
- Yes.

314
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,606
- And I'm in Stars Hollow.
- Correct.

315
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,983
- And you're...
- Thinking where I should take you.

316
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:12,776
No, where I should take you.

317
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,404
This is my town.
You know nothing around here.

318
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:18,115
No, but I was the one
who asked you out initially...

319
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,575
so therefore I am still obligated
to do the taking.

320
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:23,661
But I was the one who did the canceling
after you did the asking.

321
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:27,122
Therefore you forfeit
your taking rights to me, the canceller.

322
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,749
- So we're actually gonna do this?
- Yes, we are.

323
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,501
Let me just give this guy my keys,
and then we'll go.

324
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,795
- Great.
- "Great" is an understatement.

325
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:38,589
I just don't understand
why you waited so late to call.

326
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,883
Are you sure?

327
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:45,137
Fine. All right. Yes, goodbye.

328
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,722
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

329
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:49,224
What's the problem, Emily?

330
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:53,227
The problem is that apparently Florence
cannot get here because of the storm.

331
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:55,937
Our cook.

332
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,398
We'll just have to go out, then.

333
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:02,443
Please, Richard, pay attention.
We can't go out. It's miserable out there.

334
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,278
We'll figure something out.

335
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:06,113
What? What will we figure out?

336
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:08,407
- I don't know, but...
- I hate the damn snow.

337
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,075
- Emily, calm down.
- This is a serious problem.

338
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:14,870
These Friday dinners are the only
proper food that child eats all week.

339
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,914
Rory, are you in any way malnourished...

340
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:22,043
or in need of some international
relief organization to recruit a celebrity...

341
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,211
to raise money on your account?

342
00:19:24,586 --> 00:19:26,755
- I'm good.
- She's good, Emily.

343
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:30,508
Your sense of humor rears its ugly head
at the oddest of times, Richard.

344
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:34,428
I'm not the mastermind behind some
great scheme to spoil your dinner plans...

345
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,472
and I don't care to be treated as such.

346
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,391
So you're fine with
having no dinner tonight, is that it?

347
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:42,560
- I certainly am not.
- How about I check the fridge?

348
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:45,438
I'm sure there's something in there
we could whip up.

349
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,730
- Whip up?
- Yeah, come on.

350
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,817
It'll be fun, I promise.

351
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,694
Come on, Mr. We'Il-figure-it-out.

352
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,366
- Nothing.
- Not a blessed thing.

353
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,575
There's frozen pizza.

354
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,369
- How did that get there?
- Maybe you bought it and forgot.

355
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,913
I've never bought frozen pizza.
It must belong to Anna.

356
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,163
- The maid.
- Yes.

357
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,456
Got one!

358
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,710
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make it.

359
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,421
- You're not serious.
- That hardly looks like dinner.

360
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:19,424
I agree. Rory, that's food you eat
at a carnival or in a Turkish prison.

361
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:20,800
I promise you'll love it.

362
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:23,094
- But...
- Listen, just leave it up to me.

363
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:27,097
You guys go back to the living room,
and I'll call you when it's ready.

364
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:29,891
- Grandma?
- Yes?

365
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,727
What are the odds you'd know
where a cookie sheet would be?

366
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,938
- I'd say very slim.
- Never mind. I'll find it.

367
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,648
Very slim? Thank you for that.

368
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,650
Thank you. Hold that.

369
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:43,944
Thanks.

370
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,740
- God, it's a beautiful night.
- Yes, it is.

371
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,826
- So, tell me something about yourself.
- Like what?

372
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,786
- Have you ever been married?
- Nope.

373
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,995
- Ever been close?
- Once.

374
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,497
- And?
- She's in Thailand.

375
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:57,914
- Sex trade?
- Bank of America.

376
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,207
It's usually one or the other.

377
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,293
She went there on business.
She did well. She never came back.

378
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,961
- Sad.
- It was, at the time.

379
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:07,256
- But if it was meant to be...
- He believes in fate.

380
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,216
Fate, poetry, love.
They all go together, don't they?

381
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,468
Yes, they do.

382
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,761
- How about you?
- I've never been married.

383
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,221
- Ever been close?
- Rory's dad proposed.

384
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:19,432
- What happened?
- The bell rang. I was late for chem lab.

385
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:21,309
You ever sorry that you didn't?

386
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,229
No, we were so young and my life
would've been completely different.

387
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:27,814
You know, I wouldn't live here.
I wouldn't work here.

388
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:30,400
I wouldn't be walking here with you.

389
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,863
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

390
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,615
Are we gonna get there before we freeze?

391
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,325
What kind of fun would it be
if I told you the answer?

392
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,868
- You're crazy.
- Very possible.

393
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,579
- And I'm following you.
- Yes, you are.

394
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:47,957
- So possibly I'm crazier then you are.
- Again, very possible.

395
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,916
- A match made in heaven.
- Or in Bellevue.

396
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,626
It must be fate.

397
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,003
This is getting ridiculous, Aaron.

398
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,673
I will not continue to have
these conversations with a child.

399
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,508
Yes, he is a child.

400
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:02,551
When he's worked 30 years
at the company, he won't be a child.

401
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:05,638
Until then,
I don't care what his opinions are.

402
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,764
Aaron, are you listening to me?

403
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,974
Good, because I'm hanging up
on you now...

404
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:12,936
and I wanted to make sure
that you heard it.

405
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:14,395
What a moron.

406
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,443
Hello, Rory?

407
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,030
- Where are you?
- I'm at my grandparents'.

408
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:17,447
What are you doing at my house?

409
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,950
- Like you care.
- What are you talking about?

410
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:21,868
You're never around when I need you.

411
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:24,328
You know I have to go
to my grandparents' on Fridays.

412
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:27,290
I know. You go to your grandparents'.
You go to Chilton.

413
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,583
You have to meet Dean. He needs
his cookies. "I can't find my books."

414
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,959
What are you taking about?

415
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,628
Why have a best friend
when she's never around...

416
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:37,756
never listens, has no interest
in the fact that you're in love...

417
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:40,425
- or that you touched his hair?
- You touched whose hair?

418
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:45,471
Why would you touch
Rich Bloomenfeld's hair?

419
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:48,932
Why? That's a good question.
I don't know why.

420
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:52,811
Why would a sane person
do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane.

421
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,896
Maybe I'm going through
some sort of phase.

422
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:59,108
Maybe I really needed someone to talk to
about this, and you weren't there.

423
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:00,525
Lane, come on.

424
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,986
You're always at school,
or you're talking about school...

425
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:05,446
or you're with Dean.

426
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:07,615
You have everything now,
and I have nothing...

427
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:11,326
except for 2,000 Korean Bibles
and a potential "F" in jazz band.

428
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,702
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,870
Don't be sorry. Be here.

430
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,541
Lane? Are you there?

431
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:25,213
- There you are.
- I think the phones went dead.

432
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,422
It's probably just this horrible storm.

433
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:30,759
- You must come downstairs immediately.
- What's wrong?

434
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:33,511
- The stove is buzzing.
- It's just the timer, Grandma.

435
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:36,472
I know it's the timer.
I don't know where it's located...

436
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:39,474
- or how to turn it off.
- But I really need to call Lane back.

437
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:42,060
You can do nothing.
The phones will eventually come back.

438
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:44,812
Please come downstairs
and help me stop the buzzing.

439
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:47,439
Emily, for heaven's sake, get down here.

440
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:48,816
Okay, let's go.

441
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:54,779
So, the fiesta burger...

442
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,322
Very interesting.

443
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,240
- Very spicy?
- Oh, yeah.

444
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,493
- How's your tongue?
- Much better, thank you.

445
00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:08,624
- Are you scared yet?
- Not yet.

446
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,252
- Are you scared yet?
- I'm still good.

447
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:13,503
Are you scared yet?

448
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,880
- You're very annoying in a movie.
- I know.

449
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:18,799
I think it's very important
that you know my faults...

450
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:21,968
as well as my many attributes.

451
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:24,846
- Very thoughtful of you.
- It is, isn't it?

452
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:27,515
Because, as you know...

453
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:30,058
you can get carried away
by your many attributes...

454
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,477
and suddenly find yourself thinking,
"Oh, my God!"

455
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,229
"This woman is absolutely perfect."

456
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:39,358
We wouldn't want that, now, would we?

457
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,985
No, we wouldn't.

458
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,665
You want to eat it before it gets cold.

459
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,002
- How is it?
- Not cold.

460
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,587
It's quite tasty.

461
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,339
- Emily, we should have this more often.
- What?

462
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:10,508
Perhaps instead of that horrible salmon
that keeps showing up.

463
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,885
That salmon is a fine delicacy.

464
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,096
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

465
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,390
Try it again, Grandma.
It's probably cooler now.

466
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,600
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
- You know what?

467
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:23,019
It's really good
if you add some extra Parmesan to it.

468
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:24,771
This is Mom's special trick.

469
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:27,022
Frozen pizza is a staple at our house.

470
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:30,400
Mom's become a major doctoring genius.
She'll put anything on it.

471
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,111
One time Sookie came
and brought us some foie gras...

472
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,988
- and mom stuck it on a pizza.
- How was it?

473
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:38,991
Pretty good once we took the foie gras off.

474
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,869
Okay, that's good.

475
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,246
Try it. Please?

476
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:50,834
If you want to get really crazy,
you can pick it up.

477
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,544
Well, all right.

478
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,046
Here goes nothing.

479
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:00,884
- That's wonderful!
- See?

480
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,011
Rory, pass me that cheese.

481
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,222
Trust me.

482
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,266
It makes all the difference.

483
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:11,351
I'll be right back.

484
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,443
I found this in Mom's room.

485
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:23,445
- What's that?
- Pictures.

486
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:26,197
Oh, my goodness,
I haven't seen that in years.

487
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,781
Oh, my gosh.

488
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:31,701
Look at this.

489
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,828
That's one fluffy white dress.

490
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:35,830
There were 12 petticoats underneath it.

491
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:38,081
We got it in London, remember, Richard?

492
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:39,624
She looks like a little princess.

493
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,836
I believe about two minutes
after that picture was taken...

494
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:45,255
Her Highness dumped
a glass of grape juice over it.

495
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,590
- Look, Emily, it's Hopey.
- Hopey?

496
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,757
My younger sister.

497
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,842
Have I ever seen her?
I don't remember her.

498
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:53,428
She lives in Paris. Our great expatriate.

499
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,639
Hopey, look at you.
I haven't seen her in such a long time.

500
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:59,641
- Maybe we should take a trip this year.
- That would be nice.

501
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:03,311
- Maybe Rory could go with us.
- I'll start packing tomorrow.

502
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:05,981
- Is that you guys?
- Yes, it is.

503
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:08,649
- That is our wedding picture.
- That's an amazing dress.

504
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:12,319
It should've been. My mother had three
seamstresses working round the clock.

505
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:15,363
- You still have it?
- It's upstairs packed away somewhere.

506
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:16,823
I'll save it for you if you like.

507
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:20,033
Rory's too young
to be thinking about things like that.

508
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,411
Every young girl thinks about her wedding.
I know I did.

509
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,163
I knew when I was 12
that I wanted lilies and orchids...

510
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,624
with a silver bow wrapped around them
for my bouquet.

511
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,001
You also knew
that you wanted to marry Errol Flynn.

512
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,796
- Grandma had a thing for the pirate guy?
- I did not.

513
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:36,339
She was mad about him.

514
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,674
She tried to get me to grow
one of those mustaches.

515
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:40,176
- You're kidding.
- Richard, stop.

516
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,261
She wanted me
to swing from a chandelier.

517
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:43,470
Now you're just being silly.

518
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:45,846
Luckily, I was on the fencing team
at college...

519
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,057
or I would have married
Lucinda Lester by now.

520
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:52,977
Actually, Lucinda Lester
looked a lot like Errol Flynn.

521
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,356
I should have married her.
It would have been very modern of me.

522
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,358
Mom looks really beautiful here.

523
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:03,612
- Yes, she does.
- What was the occasion?

524
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:06,531
Who would like some coffee?

525
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:09,491
That was her debutante gown
for her coming-out party.

526
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,494
- Mom had a coming-out party?
- No, she didn't.

527
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,708
Yes, well, things happen, don't they?

528
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,627
If you'll excuse me,
I have some business calls to make.

529
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,671
I'll go get that coffee.

530
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,402
- Here.
- What is this?

531
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:53,903
- I brought you coffee.
- No, thank you.

532
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:56,489
Harry, you're freezing.
Take the damn coffee.

533
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:59,491
When our forefathers stood out here
many moons ago...

534
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:02,035
- they didn't have any coffee.
- How do you know?

535
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:04,746
Do you have written documentation
about what beverages...

536
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,791
they did or did not have on that long,
historic night of standing?

537
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,585
This is still a joke to you, young man.

538
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:15,088
I don't choose to be a joke.
We don't need your coffee.

539
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:18,508
Harry, please. Take the coffee.

540
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:23,220
My father would have taken the coffee.

541
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,722
Well, all right, then. Thank you.

542
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,142
- Andrew?
- Thank you, Luke.

543
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,811
- Kirk?
- You got any herbal tea?

544
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:34,770
Not on me, but I can get some.

545
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,772
- With a squeeze of lemon.
- Okay.

546
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,858
I could really go for some cocoa.

547
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:40,776
- That sounds good.
- Cocoa for me, too.

548
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,903
Okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea...

549
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:46,447
and two cocoas.

550
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:51,576
- Yeah, that part was a little slow.
- Slow?

551
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,204
But it picked up pretty soon after that,
don't you think?

552
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:10,717
- So this is it, my house.
- Nice.

553
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,136
Thank you.

554
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:14,637
Good porch.

555
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:17,932
Nice windows.

556
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:22,811
Front door.

557
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,771
- Which opens, I assume.
- Yeah.

558
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:28,816
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

559
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:31,234
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I...

560
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:35,864
I was so excited about the snow,
and about seeing you...

561
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:38,950
- Thank you.
...that I didn't really think this thing out.

562
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:41,160
And I usually think this kind of thing out.

563
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:44,662
- So I'm just thinking this thing out.
- What thing?

564
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:47,957
- Inviting a man over to my house.
- Okay.

565
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:51,126
See, I have really strict rules about dating.

566
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:55,380
I keep my personal life totally separate
from my life with Rory.

567
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,924
I never want her to feel unsettled...

568
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:00,760
or like her life could just shift
at any moment.

569
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:02,386
I totally understand.

570
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:04,972
And she comes first,
and this her house, too.

571
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:08,433
I understand.
This is something that you don't do often.

572
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:09,892
- Ever.
- Ever?

573
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,644
- Never.
- I see.

574
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:15,730
I mean, I've dated.

575
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:18,357
And, you know, dated.

576
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:23,112
But I've just never dated...

577
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:26,489
here, in our house.

578
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:30,701
What if I promised you
that if you let me in...

579
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,870
all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee?
That's it.

580
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,205
Nothing weird or funny.

581
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:41,877
Unless you're into weird and funny,
'cause I could do weird and funny.

582
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,797
I've been enjoying
the hell out of myself tonight...

583
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,216
- and I think you are, too.
- I am.

584
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,634
So, it's snowing...

585
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,846
- cold, and your daughter is elsewhere.
- I know.

586
00:32:56,722 --> 00:32:59,725
The whole night's been
a weird kismet of events.

587
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,561
- It's that fate guy again.
- At some point in your life...

588
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:06,898
you have to decide that some guy
is worth opening that front door for.

589
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:09,066
I am just volunteering.

590
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,700
Would you like some coffee?

591
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:29,041
How strong do you like your coffee?
'Cause I've built up such a tolerance to it...

592
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:31,002
I make it too intense for most people.

593
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:33,879
I lived through the fiesta burger.
Don't hold back now.

594
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:39,092
- Can I help?
- Yeah, you can fill up the pot.

595
00:33:39,175 --> 00:33:41,051
I'm very good at that.

596
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:45,931
- Six cups sounds good?
- Fine.

597
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:48,641
What are you gonna have?

598
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:51,727
You do know
that was a leading question, right?

599
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,354
Really? How so?

600
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,443
- How badly do you want that coffee?
- Not badly.

601
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:02,236
Such a good answer.

602
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,304
How many kids did you say you have?

603
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,971
One. Why?

604
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,639
Lane! Hi!

605
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:42,061
- We're just... What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. I was waiting for Rory.

606
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:45,772
I'll just go back into her room,
and I won't come back out. I promise.

607
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:55,447
That's The Cure. I have to go back in there.

608
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:57,991
It's okay, I'll finish up the coffee.

609
00:34:58,074 --> 00:35:01,243
- I'll be back as fast as humanly possible.
- Good.

610
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:12,544
I'm sorry I messed up your date.

611
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:15,296
You didn't mess up my date.
What's going on?

612
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:20,134
- I was waiting for Rory to get home.
- Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.

613
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,762
I didn't know. I'll just go.

614
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,139
Do you want to talk?

615
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,684
I'm not Rory,
but we do use the same blow dryer.

616
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,644
I did something really stupid today.

617
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:35,939
- Okay, what did you pierce?
- Nothing.

618
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:40,276
- I touched a boy's hair.
- Okay.

619
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:44,363
- A boy I really like.
- So far I'm missing the stupid part.

620
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:48,324
- I kind of did it without his permission.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

621
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,744
I don't know what happened.
I was just standing there.

622
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:54,747
And then he bends over,
and his hair falls forward...

623
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,248
and suddenly it's like
my hand has a life of its own.

624
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,584
Sounds like your hand had help
from your hormones.

625
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,670
God, I'm so humiliated.
I can't ever go back to school.

626
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:06,131
I'll have to be home-schooled.
My mother finally gets her way.

627
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,049
Look at it from a different perspective.

628
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,676
You have so many years of screw-ups
ahead of you.

629
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:14,304
View this as a trial run
for really grown-up humiliation.

630
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:15,722
So not helping.

631
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,266
Maybe you should be a hairdresser.

632
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,936
It's perfect. You can run your hands
through anybody's hair...

633
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,022
- and they'll pay you for it.
- What am I going to do?

634
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:28,357
Everyone at school's gonna be talking
about me. I can't show my face.

635
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:30,484
Everybody does stupid things
in high school.

636
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:32,445
- It's a requirement.
- Not like this.

637
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:34,697
No, some people get pregnant.

638
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:38,574
Talk about something really juicy
for the gossip mill.

639
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:40,117
I forgot about that.

640
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,163
Everybody screws up, Lane.
That's what happens.

641
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,914
It's what you do with the screw-ups...

642
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:50,084
how you handle the experience...
That's what you should judge yourself by.

643
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,295
I have a great life and an amazing kid.

644
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,048
And I took a detour.

645
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,133
I ended up someplace good.

646
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,095
Tell me this.

647
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,930
How did his hair feel? Good as it looked?

648
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,306
Better.

649
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:09,767
You're gonna be fine.
I'm positive about that.

650
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,978
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

651
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:15,022
So who's the guy?

652
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:17,816
Rory's teacher.

653
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:20,568
He has nice hair.

654
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:36,414
- Everything okay in there?
- It will be.

655
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,500
So, where did we leave off?

656
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,795
Lane is gonna stay here tonight.

657
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,714
She had a really bad teen day...

658
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,508
and she needs to crash
someplace sympathetic.

659
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:50,384
Okay, I understand.

660
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,470
I swear to God, if this wasn't
a major Judy Blume moment...

661
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:56,640
I would kick her cute little butt
right out of here.

662
00:37:56,724 --> 00:38:00,477
Can you recommend a hotel
that's really close to here?

663
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,397
Why don't you just stay here tonight?
Everybody else is.

664
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,440
- I don't know.
- Really, the couch is comfortable.

665
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:11,778
And there's pillows and blankets.
The bathroom's through there.

666
00:38:11,944 --> 00:38:14,405
And the kitchen has nothing in it...

667
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:17,074
but running water if you get thirsty.

668
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:19,951
And it's an awful night.

669
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,829
- Okay, if it's not a problem.
- Not at all.

670
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:27,457
Could I at least give you a kiss good-night?

671
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:30,334
Only if you intend to live till morning.

672
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:41,302
Good night.

673
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,716
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

674
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,051
You have something to tell me.

675
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:32,512
Boy, you're so smart.
Right. Okay. Here we go.

676
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:34,763
I've got a boy in the house.

677
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,015
- You what?
- Nothing happened, I swear.

678
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:40,226
- He slept on the couch. And you know him.
- I do?

679
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,478
You like him.
I don't know if that's relevant.

680
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:45,648
I just thought
that I would throw that in there.

681
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,359
- It's Mr. Medina.
- I know.

682
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:52,195
My English teacher is on my couch.

683
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:57,199
It was the snow.
You know how I get. It's like catnip.

684
00:39:57,991 --> 00:40:02,328
I was walking. He was there.
His car was broken. We had fiesta burgers.

685
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,705
It was the snow.

686
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,416
Rory, say something.

687
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:14,963
Rory, talk to me.

688
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,299
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

689
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:19,717
Take a guess: Angry, frustrated, nauseous?

690
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,552
Weird. I feel weird.

691
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:24,138
- Has he been here all night?
- Pretty much.

692
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,973
Oh, my God! Did he go into the bathroom?

693
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,225
I have stuff hanging in there!

694
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,185
You knew I was gonna date him.
This isn't a total surprise.

695
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:35,189
Yes, I knew you were gonna date.
I just didn't expect for him to be here...

696
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:37,900
- at our house in the morning.
- I know.

697
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:40,902
I don't even remember ever
there being a man in our house.

698
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,571
Yeah, well, I kind of broke the rules.

699
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:46,448
God, why is this so weird for me?

700
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:49,034
Because I should have told you first.

701
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,118
No.

702
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:52,870
Because I should have talked to you
before I did this.

703
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:56,624
Because you're afraid he smooshed
the couch pillows out of shape?

704
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,083
Do you love him?

705
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,712
We had one date. It was a great date.

706
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:06,465
World Series level. But it was just a date.

707
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,887
Honey, I promised myself
a long time ago...

708
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,556
that I was gonna keep all this stuff
separate from you.

709
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,850
And I want you to know that,
that still stands, okay?

710
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,935
This was a one-time thing.

711
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,146
I'm not gonna start
just bringing guys home.

712
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:24,981
This is not a trend.

713
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,482
- You can, you know.
- What?

714
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:28,942
Bring guys home.

715
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:32,112
If you like someone,
you should feel comfortable doing that.

716
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:35,072
- I appreciate that.
- I want you to be happy.

717
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:36,657
And I love you for that.

718
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,575
Plus, I know you're not a cat person...

719
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:40,744
so you will be alone
if you don't find someone.

720
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:44,621
Okay, look,
someday I will bring somebody home.

721
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,709
But when I do,
I just want to be sure it's the guy.

722
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,629
- Mr. Medina's not the guy?
- I don't know.

723
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:54,505
He might be.

724
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:57,341
But right now, it's just you and me.

725
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,300
And sometimes Lane.

726
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,265
I'm gonna go wake the man up.

727
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:11,853
Your mom let me spend the night here.

728
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:15,355
I tried calling you all night,
but the phones didn't work until morning.

729
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,400
- That's okay. I understand.
- Lane, I'm so sorry.

730
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,026
I've been the worst friend lately.

731
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:22,570
No, I just wigged out a little.

732
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:25,114
I get jealous sometimes.

733
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:28,659
I mean, you seem to have
this really great life going...

734
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,452
and I don't really fit in there.

735
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,287
That's not true. You totally fit in.

736
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:36,999
- Yeah?
- I'm talking Legos.

737
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:39,083
I hope so.

738
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:41,836
I will be better from now on, I promise.

739
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,673
- Twenty-four hours a day, at your disposal.
- Dean will love that.

740
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:48,342
Well, he'll have to. You came first.

741
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,386
That's right. I got dibs.

742
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,516
Okay. I have to go home.

743
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:02,103
- Coffee at Luke's, 2:00?
- You're on.

744
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:04,438
I wanna hear all about
that hair-touching incident.

745
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:08,317
Yeah. And I wanna hear the rest
of the teacher-on-the-couch incident.

746
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,484
Deal.
