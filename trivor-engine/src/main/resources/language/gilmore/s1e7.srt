1
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,756
- One of us has got to do laundry tonight.
- Why?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,343
Because I haven't had
any clean underwear for three days.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,720
So right now under your skirt
you're wearing...

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,555
- Not underwear.
- Mom!

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,849
It's kind of nice actually. Breezy.

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,935
My role model, ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,145
How come you haven't run out yet?

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,648
I don't know.
I guess I have more underwear than you.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,816
That's not true. You have less.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,319
- Have you been doing laundry without me?
- No.

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,279
- Rory?
- Okay, one load.

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,990
You didn't even ask
if I had stuff to throw in?

13
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,909
It was a big load. There wasn't any room.

14
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,953
I'm crushed and bleeding.
Get me a tourniquet.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,830
No. They're dirty'cause Rory
won't wash them with her stuff.

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,541
Sorry. I'll do another load tonight,
I promise.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,126
Never mind. I'll do my own laundry.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,004
- Fine, even better.
- I hate doing laundry.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,840
Maybe I'll just buy new underwear.

20
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,427
And flutter, flutter.

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,137
And leaves.

22
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,973
Where are my leaves?

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,850
I got pumpkins, I got Pilgrims.
I got no leaves.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,605
Every other store in town
has fall decorations.

25
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,315
Hurrah for the mob mentality.

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,776
We're talking a few streamers
and a paper turkey.

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,820
How is it gonna hurt
to have a paper turkey?

28
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,906
No turkeys, no squash, no pumpkins.
Nothing colored orange.

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,702
Okay. So you don't like orange. That's fine.

30
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,913
Autumn has many varied hues to toy with.

31
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,581
Excuse me, could we get some coffee?

32
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:22,874
- And a muffin?
- Warmed?

33
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,668
This is the Autumn Festival.

34
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,587
Your shop is right across the street
from the horn of plenty.

35
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,298
You're in the middle of everything.
You have to decorate.

36
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,050
All I have to do is serve food.

37
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,885
- And coffee!
- And muffins.

38
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,056
Taylor, I'm tired of having
this conversation with you every year.

39
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,976
You have lived in Stars Hollow
for a long time, young man.

40
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,311
It's time you became one of us.

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,106
Sorry, I guess my pod's defective.

42
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,692
My mom's not wearing any underwear.

43
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,570
- Well, you aren't.
- You're being selfish, Luke.

44
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,905
Still they don't notice.
I can't take it anymore.

45
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,241
We're talking about the spirit of fall.

46
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,951
- What muffin do you want?
- Blueberry.

47
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,203
You know where you can stick
the spirit of fall?

48
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,080
Here, don't use your hands.

49
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,917
I don't think you're taking me seriously.

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,545
What gave you that idea? No tip?

51
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,089
Yeah, here's a tip: Serve your customers.

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,092
Here's another:
Don't sit on any cold benches.

53
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,012
If you pull those Pilgrims
out of your pocket once more...

54
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,430
I'm just doing it for you.

55
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,590
I don't know.

56
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,010
It doesn't really look like the Mayflower.

57
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,471
We could put a sign on it or something.

58
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,390
I don't know.

59
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,643
So, you want to go back to
the Plymouth Rock idea?

60
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,314
We'll just live with it that way for a day.

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,275
Okay, sure.

62
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,740
- You know, you can get two for $3.
- Really? Excellent deal.

63
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,201
You just had a desperate need
for some cornstarch?

64
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,663
Yes, I have very important
thickening needs, thank you.

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,833
- Nice apron.
- Nice uniform.

66
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:14,504
I sewed the buttons on with silver thread,
so that sets me apart from the crowd.

67
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,717
- I should get home.
- Wait, you want a pop or something?

68
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,843
A pop?

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,137
Give me a break.
In Chicago they call it pop.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,433
In Connecticut, we call it free soda.
And, yes, thank you.

71
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,358
All right, guess what's in each hand,
you get the soda.

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,028
Okay, the whole concept of a free soda
is that it's free.

73
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,362
You don't have to work for it.

74
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,907
- Sorry, you got to sing for your supper.
- Or your soda.

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,701
- Guess.
- Okay.

76
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,078
In this hand you have...

77
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,671
Thank you.

78
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,416
- What's wrong?
- I got kissed.

79
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,169
And I shoplifted.

80
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,755
- Are you serious? Who kissed you?
- Dean.

81
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,215
- The new kid?
- Yes.

82
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,801
You got the new kid? Oh, my God.

83
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,303
It happened so fast.
I was just standing there.

84
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,638
- Where?
- Doose's Market.

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,723
- He kissed you in the market?
- On Aisle 3.

86
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,308
- By the ant spray?
- Yes.

87
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,311
- That's a good aisle.
- What defines a good aisle?

88
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,439
An aisle where you get kissed
by the new kid is a good aisle.

89
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,525
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.

90
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,778
- Okay, sit down.
- No, I can't sit down. I'm too...

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,863
Oh, my God, he kissed me.

92
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,407
- Who kissed you?
- The Lord, Mama.

93
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,618
Okay, then.

94
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,164
So, tell me everything.

95
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,917
So, I go into the store,
and he offers me a soda.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,546
Then he puts two behind his back and
asks me to pick one, and he kissed me.

97
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,757
I'm so jealous. That's it,
I've got to get some dumb, ugly friends.

98
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,801
- I have to go tell my mom.
- Call me later.

99
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,969
Okay.

100
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,597
- What's wrong?
- I can't.

101
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,934
You can't leave? It's hymn night
at the Kim house. Make a run for it.

102
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,853
- My mom doesn't know about Dean.
- So tell her.

103
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,690
The last time the subject of boys came up,
it got very ugly.

104
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,985
That was different. She thought
you wanted to quit school over a guy.

105
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,403
Yes, over Dean.

106
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,989
Okay, fine.
But she doesn't have to know it was him.

107
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,282
- She'll know.
- How?

108
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,660
She'll know. She's Lorelai. What do I do?

109
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,789
Maybe she'll be more open to the concept
now that you're in school and doing well.

110
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,374
- Maybe.
- Try it.

111
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
Okay. I got to go.

112
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,629
Was it great?

113
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,589
It was perfect.

114
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,633
- Wow.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,098
Yeah, can you hear that?

116
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,685
No, it's higher.

117
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,314
It's like a high-pitched kind of a... sound.

118
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,940
It started last week.

119
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,568
But was lower and only happened
when we opened the door.

120
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,236
Now it's higher and on all the time.

121
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,281
So I think it's really growing in confidence.

122
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,409
Look, I've already told this
to three other people.

123
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,079
So could you just please tell me
what is wrong with this fridge?

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,374
I'm not gonna make the noise again.

125
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,792
I'm not...

126
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,713
Jerry, I don't have a lot of pride...

127
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,841
but I do have enough that I do not want
to make that noise again.

128
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,385
So could you tell me
what is wrong with the fridge...

129
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,929
or connect me with someone who can?

130
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,598
Thank you.

131
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,809
Hello, Rusty? Great.

132
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,855
Listen, my fridge is making
this weird sound.

133
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,108
It's a high-pitched...
You know what, is Jerry still there?

134
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,778
Okay, have him make the sound.
He knows it.

135
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,196
I'll wait.

136
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,408
I know. It does sound bad.

137
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,620
Okay, here is the deal.

138
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,707
You will send someone out here tomorrow
between 8:00 and 9:00.

139
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,920
Because I work and can't wait four hours
for one of you guys to show up.

140
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,923
Great. Goodbye.

141
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,221
- So, are they coming tomorrow?
- Nope. Monday, between 3:00 and 8:00.

142
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,973
- I'm completely useless.
- I'm sorry.

143
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,851
God, look at this place. It's a sty.

144
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,771
Now I'm crabby. I'm crabby and useless.

145
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,150
Stupid fridge! Stupid fridge guys.

146
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,528
I hate my life.

147
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,039
Hello.

148
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,964
God, quite an entrance. Jeez, my heart.

149
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,549
Rory's not here.

150
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,678
No, I know. I came to pick up that rocker
that I bought a couple weeks ago.

151
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,306
- Six weeks ago.
- That's a couple times three. That's six.

152
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,684
Math humor.

153
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,769
It's not big with many people.
Don't feel bad.

154
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,397
- This is not a storage facility.
- I know. I'm sorry.

155
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,648
This is a furniture store.

156
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,984
Furniture comes in, people buy,
then it goes out.

157
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,071
Except when Lorelai Gilmore buys.
Then furniture stays here for six weeks.

158
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,824
- How about I pay you extra?
- I don't want you to pay extra.

159
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,995
I want you to pick up the thing
you paid for in the first place. Here.

160
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,748
- I remember it smaller.
- It's been six weeks. Maybe it grew.

161
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,377
Right. Once again, I'm really sorry.
I've been very busy.

162
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,922
Maybe you should be less busy.
Then you can remember to pick up chairs.

163
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,717
Right. Absolutely. Smell a rose, got it.

164
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,387
And then you could keep your daughter
from running around kissing boys.

165
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,807
- What?
- Lane is a young, impressionable girl.

166
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,810
She doesn't need to hear
about your daughter's kissing.

167
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,356
Are the lids tight on the paint remover?
Because you're sounding loopy to me.

168
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,899
Loopy? What's loopy?

169
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,777
- Rory's not kissing anybody.
- Yes, she is.

170
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,990
She came in here and told Lane
she kissed a boy in the grocery store.

171
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,076
The grocery store, where we buy our food.

172
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,370
This does not make any...

173
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,041
- She kissed the boy in the grocery store?
- Yes.

174
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,877
The boy in the grocery store. Kiss.

175
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,255
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

176
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,300
She didn't tell me.

177
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,763
I have to go.

178
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,726
You left your chair!

179
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,192
Okay, just one more time.

180
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,528
I have been telling you this story
for an hour. It doesn't get dirty.

181
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,157
I can't help it. I'm obsessed.
I'm totally living vicariously through you.

182
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,326
Why? You got kissed last weekend.

183
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:04,080
Remember? You told me.
That guy your parents set you up with.

184
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,791
The one with the Lincoln Continental.
What's his name?

185
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,417
- Patrick Cho.
- Okay.

186
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,586
Let's do a little
compare and contrast here.

187
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,340
You get kissed on the mouth by a cute,
cool, sexy guy you really like...

188
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,760
and I get kissed on the forehead
by a Theology major...

189
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,348
in a Members Only jacket who truly
believes rock music leads to hard drugs.

190
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,433
Fair enough. You can live through me.

191
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,061
But remember that I have no idea
what I'm doing.

192
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,273
I'm aware of that. That's why I've been
diligently gathering information for us.

193
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,442
- What kind of information?
- Let's see.

194
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,986
- Dean's from Chicago, which you know.
- I do.

195
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,115
He likes Nick Drake, Liz Phair,
and The Sugarplastic.

196
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,701
- And he's deathly allergic to walnuts.
- Walnuts bad, got it.

197
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,955
- Now, he had a girlfriend in Chicago.
- A girlfriend?

198
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,708
Her name's Beth. They went out for a year,
but split amicably before he left.

199
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,043
Now she's dating his cousin...

200
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,421
but he doesn't feel weird,
'cause he doesn't think they were in love.

201
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,841
- Beth.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

202
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,634
How'd you get all this information?

203
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,512
Through his best friend, who, by the way,
is really cool.

204
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,640
So once you get settled with Dean,
could you ask him about Todd?

205
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,016
Absolutely.

206
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,852
So, Beth?

207
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,064
I hate the name Beth. It's so... Beth.

208
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,361
Todd also said that Dean hasn't been able
to talk about anything but you...

209
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,487
for weeks.

210
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,034
Stop it.
You're giving me Patrick Cho flashbacks.

211
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,497
Luke, the food here is lovely.

212
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,374
But you know what would make it better?

213
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,168
Let me guess.
Some Autumn Festival decorations?

214
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,255
Food without ambience
isn't really food, is it?

215
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,715
More iced tea, Patty?

216
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,467
No, thank you.
It's too depressing in here for tea.

217
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,095
You realize Taylor's a head case, right?

218
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,681
Yes, but at least he's a festive one.

219
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,016
Just eat.

220
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,184
Coffee?

221
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,772
Come on, are you mad at me, too?

222
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,235
A man can't choose whether he wants
a picture of a fat, stupid bird on his wall?

223
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,071
That's the reason the Pilgrims
came here in the first place.

224
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,990
I wasn't snubbing you. I didn't hear you.

225
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,283
Now, I'm concerned about you.

226
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,702
Sorry, just feeling
a little persecuted lately.

227
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,203
- Coffee?
- Please.

228
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,747
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

229
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,206
- You don't look fine.
- Thank you.

230
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,292
- I meant you look concerned.
- I'm preoccupied.

231
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,752
- You look concerned.
- I'm not.

232
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,919
Fine. You just look it.

233
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,130
You know,
some streamers would look great here.

234
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,257
- Okay, I'm done.
- Thank you.

235
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,468
Sorry.

236
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,387
Save your apologies for the Indians.

237
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,849
People are really in a giving mood today.
The horn of plenty is packed.

238
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:31,018
That's great. Do you want some coffee?

239
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,396
No, I'll just have a sip of yours.
I have to get right back.

240
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,940
Really? I thought
we were having lunch today.

241
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,903
I can't. We're one Pilgrim short.
I only have a couple minutes.

242
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,864
- You've been really busy lately.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,949
I guess it's that end-of-the-year rush.

244
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,119
I mean, we haven't even really talked
in a couple of days.

245
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
What do you want to talk about?

246
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,624
I don't know. Anything.

247
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,794
Okay. Did you read that article
in the newspaper...

248
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,295
about the polar ice caps melting?

249
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,422
Yeah. Big deal.

250
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,967
- Fine, you pick the subject.
- Okay, great.

251
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,470
I was watching General Hospital
the other day...

252
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,097
and they have a new Lucky.

253
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,766
The old Lucky went to play something
with a real name.

254
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,227
So, the old Lucky had this girlfriend, Liz...

255
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,270
who thought that he died in a fire.

256
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,897
Then they bring on this new Lucky...

257
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,982
and you're like,
"That's not the old Lucky"...

258
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,151
because the new Lucky
has more hair gel issues.

259
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,570
Still, Liz was so upset
about his supposed death...

260
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,907
that you could not wait to see them kiss,
you know?

261
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,577
When do you have time
to watch General Hospital?

262
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,579
Okay, let's get back to the point.

263
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,956
What do you think...

264
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:38,001
about the whole Liz-Lucky kissing thing?

265
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,131
I think they're actors
being paid to play a part...

266
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,759
so it's nice that
they're living up to their obligations.

267
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,013
Can we finish this
very meaningful conversation later?

268
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,599
I promised Lane I'd get right back.

269
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
Okay. I'll see you later.

270
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,688
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

271
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,775
I'm not going to say you look concerned.

272
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,195
I won't talk about how you'd look
dressed like a guy from The Crucible.

273
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,613
Fair enough.

274
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,362
Oh, God!

275
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,990
What are you doing?

276
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,867
- I asked you first.
- I ran out of cream.

277
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,035
Yeah, me, too.

278
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:55,162
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing. Don't look.

279
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,080
- What's wrong with you?
- Rory got kissed.

280
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,206
What?

281
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,251
Rory had her first kiss. And that guy did it.

282
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,046
- The new kid.
- Yep.

283
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,841
- Look at him. Look how smug he is.
- He's bagging groceries.

284
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:11,762
- It's hard to be smug bagging groceries.
- Look how he handled those lemons.

285
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,139
- What're you saying?
- He threw them in the bag.

286
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,309
Not tossed them or placed them,
but threw like they meant nothing.

287
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,852
- They're lemons.
- They're symbolic.

288
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,896
- We need to get you out of here.
- No.

289
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:24,566
That Lothario there has wormed his way
into my daughter's heart and mouth...

290
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,902
- and for that he must die.
- That's it. Let's go.

291
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:29,237
- You're not gonna kill the bag boy.
- Why not?

292
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,574
It's double-coupon day.
You'll bring down the town.

293
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,994
Okay, I'm out. Stop pushing me.

294
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,705
- What are you thinking spying like that?
- I don't know.

295
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,667
I wanted to see him. I've seen him already
but before he was...

296
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,001
- Rory's boyfriend?
- Shush, you.

297
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,378
- She's growing up.
- I know.

298
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,962
There's nothing you can do about it.

299
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,590
Okay, Mr. Reality,
break into somebody else's house.

300
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,841
Sorry.

301
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,594
- Why didn't she tell me?
- What?

302
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,888
Why didn't Rory tell me about the kiss?

303
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,890
Maybe she didn't know
you'd take it so well.

304
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,392
You want to hear something crazy?

305
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,894
'Cause all the talk up until now
has been so normal?

306
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,397
- He kind of looks like Christopher.
- The grocery kid?

307
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,816
Yeah. He looks like Christopher.

308
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,943
And Christopher is Rory's dad?

309
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,612
The hair, the build,
something about the eyes.

310
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:14,324
- He reminds me of Christopher.
- That's not too surprising.

311
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,661
You're gonna quote Freud?
'Cause I'll push you in front of a car.

312
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,497
- This talk was going so well.
- You and Rory are a lot alike.

313
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,833
It's not surprising
you have similar tastes in men.

314
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,959
I guess.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,421
But why? Why didn't she tell me?
We tell each other everything.

316
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,757
- This is different.
- But we tell each other everything else.

317
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,802
But this she keeps a secret.
It's 'cause it's a guy thing.

318
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,554
- Probably.
- That's not good.

319
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,640
I have to make her understand
I'm okay with the guy thing...

320
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:41,226
'cause not talking about guys
and our personal lives...

321
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,854
that's me and my mom.
That is not me and Rory.

322
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,773
- Are you okay with the guy thing?
- Yes.

323
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,484
- Really?
- Okay-ish.

324
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,903
- That's not okay.
- That's okay with an "ish."

325
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,363
Whatever you say.

326
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:56,783
She thinks I'll disapprove, right?
Well, I won't.

327
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,661
I will show her that I think this is great.

328
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,955
Once she sees that I think this is great...

329
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,457
everything will be back to normal
between us, right?

330
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,334
Right, okay, good.

331
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,880
So you passed the need for
an actual person to talk to minutes ago.

332
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,507
- Yeah, before the gelato stand.
- You're an amazing woman.

333
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,301
Thank you for noticing.

334
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,156
Sorry I'm late.

335
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:40,160
- No big deal. There's Chinese in the fridge.
- Okay.

336
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,500
So, kissed any good boys lately?

337
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,128
- Who?
- Mrs. Kim.

338
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,422
Of course.

339
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,386
- So, he's cute.
- Yeah, he is.

340
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,932
- Can he spell?
- He can spell and read.

341
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,936
- How long have you known?
- Since this morning.

342
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,229
You didn't think you could keep it a secret.

343
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:11,107
- You were making out in the market.
- We weren't making out.

344
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,776
It was just one kiss.

345
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,571
Yeah, by the time that gets to Miss Patty's
it's a scene from Nine 1/2 Weeks.

346
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,532
You've known all this time?
At Luke's? Here?

347
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:20,909
Yeah.

348
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,243
You could have said something.

349
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,664
Now, funny. I was going to say
the same thing to you.

350
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,795
- What now?
- Now? Nothing.

351
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,673
No? No lecture about kissing a boy?

352
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,384
- No. Why, did you do it wrong?
- No.

353
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,928
I don't think.

354
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:41,971
I didn't love the way I found out...

355
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:46,142
but you're getting older. These things
are bound to happen occasionally.

356
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,270
- Actually, I think it's great.
- No, you don't.

357
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,314
Yes, I do. I'm thrilled.

358
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,775
- Thrilled?
- Yeah.

359
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,152
You're completely weirded out by this,
aren't you?

360
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,780
No, you're crazy. I'm perfectly fine with it.

361
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,658
You don't seem fine.
You seem the complete opposite of fine.

362
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,326
You're projecting that on me'cause...

363
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,204
you don't want to think that I'm fine
when I am fine.

364
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,372
Okay.

365
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,126
Never been finer.

366
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,460
Got it.

367
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,300
- You want some?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

368
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,307
We must be quick
'cause the video store's gonna close.

369
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,936
So stick to our list. No impulse
buying like toothpaste or soap.

370
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,108
- Rory?
- You know what?

371
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,444
I think we have enough stuff
to eat at home.

372
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:41,364
Really? Where do you live?
'Cause the home I left had nothing.

373
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,159
- We're ordering pizza. That's enough.
- Are you crazy?

374
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:47,078
You can't watch Willy Wonka
without heaps of junk food.

375
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,039
It's not right. I won't allow it.
We're going in.

376
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,003
- Rory, it's fine.
- It's too weird.

377
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,339
- I'm gonna have to meet him eventually.
- Okay, how about next year?

378
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm going to be so cool in there,
you will mistake me for Shaft.

379
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,846
- There will be no interrogation.
- I swear.

380
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,140
No kissing noises.
No stories from my childhood.

381
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,225
No referring to Chicago as ChiTown.

382
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,895
No James Dean jokes.
No father-with-a-shotgun stares.

383
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,564
- No Nancy Walker impressions.
- Come on.

384
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,401
- Promise me.
- I really and truly promise.

385
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,820
Now can we please go to the market?

386
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,823
Okay, let's go.

387
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,662
I don't see him.

388
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,332
All right, maybe he's on a break.

389
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,292
Yeah, maybe he's on a break.

390
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,587
- Okay, good. So we can shop.
- Yep.

391
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,672
Do we want marshmallows?

392
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,259
And jellybeans. And chocolate Kisses.

393
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,054
Cookie dough we have at home,
peanut butter...

394
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,224
Do they have that thing
with a sugar stick on one side...

395
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,726
but you dip it in sugar
on the other side and eat it?

396
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,563
We are gonna be so sick.
It's amazing that we still function.

397
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,815
There he is.

398
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,236
Boy, he's tall. That must have been
some back-bender, that kiss.

399
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,030
Make sure you warm up next time.

400
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,991
- Okay, we are leaving now.
- Sorry. Done now.

401
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,371
He's got great eyes.
You got to love a guy with great eyes.

402
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,164
- And a nice smile.
- Very nice.

403
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,708
- Think we can get him to turn around?
- It's nice, too.

404
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,377
- Really?
- Trust me.

405
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,754
You girls having another movie night?

406
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,756
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.

407
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,009
- Isn't that the one with Gene Hackman?
- Gene Wilder.

408
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,803
- You're a Wonka fan?
- Yeah.

409
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,474
Dean, this is my mom, Lorelai.
And, Mom, this is Dean.

410
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,227
- Nice to meet you, Dean.
- Yeah, you, too.

411
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,896
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

412
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,399
- $41.83.
- Wow.

413
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,777
It's expensive to slowly rot your insides,
isn't it?

414
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:44,612
Here you go.

415
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,782
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

416
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,245
So, Dean, nice meeting you.
Hope to see you again.

417
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,459
- See, that wasn't so bad.
- You're right.

418
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,586
I said nothing embarrassing,
nothing stupid.

419
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,798
- I appreciate that.
- So chill out, supermarket slut.

420
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:07,510
See, even a little information
in your hands is dangerous.

421
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:15,017
- I need coffee.
- The video store closes in 10 minutes.

422
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,395
You run to the video store,
and I'll go get coffee.

423
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:19,605
Go. I'll meet you at Luke's.

424
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,734
You forgot your Red Vines.

425
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:25,319
Wow! You totally saved the night!

426
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,904
- Thanks.
- Sure.

427
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,495
- What are you doing tonight?
- Me?

428
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,165
Well, I don't know.

429
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,960
Do you want to come over?
We're ordering pizza, we got a movie.

430
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,503
Neighborhood's got a pool...

431
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:46,841
to see who falls into a sugar coma first.
I'm the favorite. It might be fun.

432
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:52,221
It's totally casual.
I'm sure Rory would love it.

433
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,223
Okay, sure. What time?

434
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,933
- 7:00 sound good?
- Sounds fine.

435
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,353
- Let me give you our address.
- That's okay. I know where you live.

436
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,690
Right. Of course you do.
So see you tonight.

437
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,233
Bye.

438
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,196
- So?
- Got it.

439
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,658
Score! I'm glad it was in,
but what kind of world do we live in...

440
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,661
where no one has rented
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory?

441
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,788
- Well, we rented it.
- Thank God for us.

442
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:20,208
I invited your friend over
to watch it with us.

443
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,834
- What friend?
- Dean.

444
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,919
What?

445
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:26,255
I told him what we were doing tonight,
and he was totally into it.

446
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,133
So... Why are you looking at me like that?

447
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:33,512
- You invited Dean to our house?
- Yes.

448
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:35,973
- Are you crazy?
- Why are you mad?

449
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,185
We haven't even been out on a date
by ourselves yet.

450
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,147
My first date with Dean is gonna be
with my mother? What is wrong with you?

451
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,691
I'm sorry.
I thought you would be happy about this.

452
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,194
In what universe would I be happy?

453
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,072
This isn't Amish country.
Girls and boys usually date alone.

454
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:54,283
I thought of it more
as a hanging out kind of session.

455
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,620
I don't want our first hanging out session
to be with my mother.

456
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,580
- Stop saying mother like that.
- Like what?

457
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,916
Like there's supposed to be
another word after it.

458
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:05,503
I can't believe you did this.
I'm so humiliated.

459
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,130
You're totally overreacting.

460
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:12,134
I invited him to a movie and pizza,
not to Niagara Falls.

461
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,345
He's the boy that I like.

462
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:18,224
I know. I looked for one that you hated.
But it was really short notice.

463
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,977
Now he's forced to come over,
sit with me and my mother...

464
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,020
and eat crap and watch a movie?

465
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,774
I just invited a friend of yours to hang out.

466
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,026
What's the big deal?
What if Lane had done it?

467
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,070
You're not Lane. You're my mother.

468
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:34,532
You inviting him over is like
Grandma inviting a guy you liked over.

469
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:37,076
- You're comparing me to my mother?
- No. I just...

470
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,121
I'm Emily Gilmore now?
My, how the mighty have fallen.

471
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:41,205
I didn't mean that.

472
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:43,874
- I wasn't trying to humiliate you.
- I know.

473
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,460
If I was Emily Gilmore,
I'd be trying to humiliate you.

474
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,630
- I just...
- Look, I'm sorry, okay? I screwed up.

475
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:51,882
I was trying to...

476
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,593
Look, I'll go. I'll uninvite him.

477
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:58,723
I'll tell him it's canceled because
I just found out that I'm my mother.

478
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:02,893
- And I have to go into intensive therapy.
- No, you can't uninvite him.

479
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,311
He'll think I wigged out.

480
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:07,273
Then I'll just disappear,
and you guys can be alone.

481
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:11,068
And have it look like
my mom arranged a date for me? No!

482
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:12,778
What do we do?

483
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,448
He has to come.

484
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:20,286
It won't be so bad, okay?
Just pizza, and a movie, and hanging out.

485
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:23,622
I promise you won't feel like
your mother is there.

486
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,252
Okay.

487
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,426
You might, however,
feel like my mother is there.

488
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,393
This is good.
Add some cold cream, and some curlers...

489
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,188
and let him know
what he'll be coming home to every night.

490
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,732
This was supposed to be a simple night.

491
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:52,318
Watch movie, eat junk,
go to bed feeling sick.

492
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,819
End of story.

493
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:57,573
Now I'm supposed to look pretty and
girly, which is completely impossible...

494
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:59,658
because I'm gross,
and I have nothing to wear.

495
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:01,827
- Do you want some help?
- No.

496
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,163
- Yes.
- Okay.

497
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,169
Let's see. This and...

498
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,715
All right, well...

499
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,219
This says,
"Hello, I'm hip and cute, but also relaxed."

500
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,098
"Since this is something I just threw on,
even though it looks fantastic on me."

501
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,017
- How did you do that?
- What?

502
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,312
I've been staring at that top
for 20 minutes. It was just a top.

503
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:30,731
You walk in,
and in three seconds it's an outfit.

504
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:35,194
It comes from years of experiencing
fashion brain freeze like the one you had.

505
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,987
- How do you do it?
- What?

506
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,864
This whole guy thing?

507
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:41,158
I've watched you when you talk to a man.

508
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,869
You have a comeback for everything.
You make him laugh.

509
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,205
- You smile right.
- I smile right?

510
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,708
- Then you do the hair flip.
- Oh, twirl. It's a hair twirl.

511
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,419
Then you walk away.
And he just stands there, amazed...

512
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,171
like he can't believe what happened.

513
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,675
- That's because I just stole his wallet.
- I'll never be able to do that.

514
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:01,428
Trig, I can do.
But boys and dating, forget it.

515
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:03,389
I'm a total spaz.

516
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,101
Listen.

517
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:11,730
The talking part, you just get used to.
The hair twirl, I can teach you.

518
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,774
And the leaving-him-amazed part...

519
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:16,735
with your brain and killer blue eyes,
I'm not worried.

520
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:20,155
You'll do fine. Just give yourself
a little time to get there.

521
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,408
- Is half an hour enough?
- Plenty.

522
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:26,495
Come on. Dab on some lip gloss,
clear but fruity. Maybe a little mascara.

523
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:29,373
Wear your hair down,
and your attitude high.

524
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,083
You're like a crazy Elsa Klensch.

525
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,004
Oh, thank you. Come on, now, hustle.
We got a man coming over.

526
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:51,687
- What time did you tell him to get here?
- 7:00.

527
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:55,983
Maybe something happened.
Maybe he's not coming.

528
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,777
Maybe he's just late, Miss German Train.

529
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:08,746
What?

530
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,790
...is one of my favorite towns.
There used to be a club there...

531
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:14,501
- What was it called, baby?
- Mister Kelly's.

532
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:16,420
Yeah, Mister Kelly's. You ever go there?

533
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:18,797
- They've got Dean.
- Wait here.

534
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:24,261
- So, Dean, you like jazz?
- He sure does.

535
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:28,140
It's all we ever hear about, right? Jazz.

536
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:31,602
Hey, sugar. We were just getting to know
your young man here.

537
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,312
Yeah, I see that.

538
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:36,565
Dean, would you mind going inside
and helping Rory out?

539
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:39,860
There's a struggle with a jar lid
that I think she's about to lose.

540
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,988
- Sure, yeah.
- It was nice talking to you, Dean.

541
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,531
Yeah, you, too.

542
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:47,284
- Stay cool, kid.
- I will.

543
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:51,205
- Oh, is he cute!
- Yeah.

544
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:53,791
And that Chuck Heston chin of his!

545
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:56,418
- Is he Rory's boyfriend?
- No, they're just friends.

546
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,961
That's not what I heard.

547
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:02,382
Kissing at the market gives
a whole new meaning to Tasting Day.

548
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:06,970
Okay. I got to get back inside and shower.
I'll talk to you guys later.

549
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:08,263
Have a good evening.

550
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:10,933
And don't forget to invite us
to the wedding.

551
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:13,727
Oh, won't their kids be gorgeous!

552
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,729
Oh, God, I hope not.

553
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,528
I'm sorry I'm late.

554
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,656
- I got here, like, a half hour ago.
- We believe you.

555
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:29,368
We'd believe you if you said
you got here three hours ago.

556
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:35,541
So, Dean, how do you like it
here in Stars Hollow?

557
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,042
I like it.

558
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:40,045
It's quiet, but nice.

559
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,675
- I like all the trees everywhere.
- Yeah, the trees here are something.

560
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:48,595
When Rory was little, she found out
that one was called a weeping willow.

561
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,598
And so she spent hours
trying to cheer it up.

562
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,226
You know, like telling it jokes and...

563
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,562
No, I'm sorry. That was me.

564
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,442
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- Okay.

565
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,323
So, this is the living room,
where we do our living.

566
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:13,495
Upstairs is my room
and the good bathroom.

567
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,917
The kitchen is right through here.

568
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,712
You ever heard a fridge yodel before?

569
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:25,382
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,926
Well, you have your basics.

571
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:31,388
Microwave for popcorn,
stove for storing shoes...

572
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:34,558
refrigerator, which is
completely worthless.

573
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,184
Interesting.

574
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,062
I'll get that.
Rory, you take over as tour guide.

575
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,940
Make sure and show him
the emergency exits.

576
00:31:43,984 --> 00:31:46,403
- That's my mom.
- She's got energy.

577
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:49,531
Yeah, well, she's 90% water, 10% caffeine.

578
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:55,537
- So, what's in there?
- That's my room.

579
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,414
Really? Can I see it?

580
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,169
Wow! Very clean.

581
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:10,218
It sucks that they use Pink Moon
in a Volkswagen commercial.

582
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,636
Oh, I know.

583
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:17,476
- So, are you gonna come in?
- Oh, no, I've seen it.

584
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:19,853
You look like
you're glued to the door there.

585
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:23,356
No, I'm just observing my room
from a new perspective.

586
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:27,778
I hardly ever stand here. It's really
making me re-think my throw pillows.

587
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:32,532
- Would you like me to get out of here?
- No, I'm fine with you looking around.

588
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:37,162
- Nice chicken.
- Or, you know, at least I was.

589
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:40,749
- We do not need dessert, Sookie.
- Everybody needs dessert.

590
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:43,293
- So, where is Rory?
- With Dean.

591
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:45,962
Oh, that's right. Dean is here.

592
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,839
Yeah, right. You need to go now.

593
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,175
- Please. I just want one little peek.
- No.

594
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:53,929
Okay, fine.
So, how are you? How are you doing?

595
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:56,139
- Sookie.
- I'm concerned.

596
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,016
- You're stalling.
- Am I?

597
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:04,648
- Hey, Lorelai.
- Hey, Joe. What do I owe you?

598
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,066
- $15 even.
- Okay.

599
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,694
- How you doing?
- Awesome.

600
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,238
What did you get on your pizza?

601
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:14,157
Did you ask for extra sauce?
I always ask for extra sauce...

602
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,202
Sookie, she's already freaked out
that I invited him here.

603
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:20,580
If she thinks I'm parading him
in front of my friends, she'll kill me.

604
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:23,667
- But, I just...
- Death, bloody and slow, okay?

605
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,086
- Mom, is that the pizza?
- Yeah.

606
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:27,879
- Okay, bye. Now go.
- I just wanted...

607
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,714
No. Bye. See you.

608
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:36,221
- So, are you hungry?
- Starving.

609
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:38,557
- Where's the pizza?
- The pizza's...

610
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,853
Just bringing in the pizza.

611
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:46,064
Hi, I'm Sookie. I'm a friend of LorelaI's.

612
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:50,151
Nice to meet you, Dean.
Not that I knew you were Dean.

613
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:52,696
But you look like a Dean.
Doesn't he look like a Dean?

614
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:56,283
Yeah, of all the people in this room,
he looks most like a Dean.

615
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:57,742
Bye, Sookie.

616
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:00,078
Have fun. Okay.

617
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:05,667
Here, I'll take that.

618
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,628
Oh, thanks. Great. The coffee table's fine.

619
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:10,839
I did not invite her.

620
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,633
Why don't you set up a camera,
broadcast it over the Internet?

621
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:15,969
Because I don't think that big.

622
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,472
Thank God there's good pizza here.

623
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,976
Yeah. We didn't know what kind you liked,
so we just got everything.

624
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,436
Everything is fine.

625
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,605
Good. Well, while it's hot.

626
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:42,495
Now, remember, no messing about.
No touching, no tasting...

627
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,497
- Who needs more?
- I do.

628
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,417
- Wow, you can eat.
- Yes, I can.

629
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,627
That's bad, isn't it?

630
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:52,839
No. Most girls don't eat. It's good you eat.

631
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:54,132
I'm all for it.

632
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:56,885
Let's talk about something
besides my eating habits.

633
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:58,970
Oompa Loompas!

634
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:04,017
My mom has a thing
for the Oompa Loompas.

635
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,811
I don't think finding them amusing
constitutes a thing.

636
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:09,856
No, but having a recurring dream
about marrying one does.

637
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,567
Don't get me started on your
Prince Charming crush, okay?

638
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,321
At least my obsessions are live.
You have a thing for a cartoon.

639
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,075
- Prince Charming, huh?
- It was a long time ago.

640
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:22,452
Not the Cinderella one,
the Sleeping Beauty one.

641
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:24,871
- 'Cause he could dance.
- Yeah.

642
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,665
I've got sisters.

643
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:31,336
So, come on, Dean,
tell us some of your embarrassing secrets.

644
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:33,797
Well, I have no embarrassing secrets.

645
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,298
Oh, please.

646
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,175
- I bet I know one.
- What?

647
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:39,719
The theme from Ice Castles
makes you cry.

648
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,638
- That's a good one.
- That's not true.

649
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:42,764
I've got one.

650
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:45,809
At the end of The Way We Were,
you wanted Robert Redford...

651
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,977
to dump his wife and kid
for Barbra Streisand.

652
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:50,522
- I've never seen The Way We Were.
- Are you kidding?

653
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,774
What are you waiting for?
Heartache, laughter...

654
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:55,360
- Communism.
- All in one neat package.

655
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:58,113
I'll have to experience that sometime.

656
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:00,490
- Next movie night.
- It's a plan.

657
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:04,202
- I'm gonna get the popcorn.
- Bring the spray cheese.

658
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,959
When does the outsider
get to suggest a movie for movie night?

659
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,878
It depends.
What movie are you thinking of?

660
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:16,673
I don't know, Boogie Nights, maybe.

661
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,926
- You'll never get it past Lorelai.
- Not a Marky Mark fan?

662
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,178
She had a bad reaction to Magnolia.

663
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:25,682
She sat there screaming for three hours,
"I want my life back!"

664
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:29,477
Then we got kicked out of the theater.
It was actually an entertaining day.

665
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,062
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

666
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,024
I guess I'll have to come up with
a different movie then.

667
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,734
I guess you will.

668
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:41,155
Are they chocolate eggs?

669
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,449
That Oompa Loompa right there.

670
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,414
You know when he's dancing...

671
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,520
...these are the geese
that lay the golden eggs.

672
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,897
As you can see,
they're larger than ordinary geese.

673
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:17,358
As a matter of fact,
they're quadruple-sized geese...

674
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:19,902
which produce octuple-sized eggs...

675
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:20,987
Thank you.

676
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,864
But Easter's over!

677
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,074
They don't know that.

678
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:28,536
- Hey, Daddy, I want a golden goose.
- Here we go again.

679
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,497
All right, sweetheart.
Daddy'll get you a golden goose...

680
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,792
- as soon as we get home.
- No, I want one of those!

681
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:38,129
Wonka, how much do you want
for the golden goose?

682
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:39,881
They're not for sale...

683
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,467
I'll be right back.

684
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:44,927
I want one...

685
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:46,095
Mom.

686
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,306
- What?
- What are you doing in here?

687
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:50,516
Trying to find a bathing suit
for my bust size.

688
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,185
Get back in there.

689
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:55,146
Why? What happened?
Did the bag boy try something?

690
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,982
He's sitting there,
he's watching the movie, he's perfect...

691
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:00,485
- and he smells really good.
- What?

692
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:03,279
He smells really good,
and he looks amazing...

693
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:05,531
and I am stupid! I said, "Thank you."

694
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:08,785
- You said "thank you"?
- When he kissed me.

695
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:10,661
He kissed you again?

696
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,663
What, is he just out of prison
or something?

697
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:15,041
No, not now. Yesterday, at the store.

698
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:17,001
All right. Strike the prison comment.

699
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:20,421
- He kissed you and you said "thank you"?
- Yes.

700
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:22,256
That was very polite.

701
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,218
No, it was stupid.
And I don't know what I'm doing.

702
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,845
What kind of chaperon are you,
sitting in the kitchen?

703
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,181
I'm not trying to be a chaperon.
I'm a girlfriend.

704
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:33,351
Well, switch gears
'cause I'm freaking out here!

705
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,686
You really like him, don't you?

706
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:39,690
- Yeah.
- Okay, then. Just calm down.

707
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:43,528
I don't want to do or say anything else
that's gonna be remotely moronic.

708
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:46,906
I'm afraid once your heart is involved
it all comes out in moron.

709
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:50,159
- Just please come back in.
- Okay. Let's go, then.

710
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,995
We can't go back in together.
That would be too obvious.

711
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,374
Right. Okay, I'll go in first,
and you go to the bathroom.

712
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:59,293
Okay, good.
Tell him I had to wash my face.

713
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:02,880
- Yes. 'Cause of all the sugar you ate.
- Yes, very good.

714
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,263
Hi. I'm back.

715
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:15,226
- Rory went to wash her face.
- Oh, okay.

716
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:21,816
...swifter than eagles,
stronger than lions...

717
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,408
Hey, Grandpa, what was that
we just went through?

718
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,914
I don't know exactly how to say this...

719
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:40,543
but this is a very different
kind of household you walked into tonight.

720
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,086
Yeah, I know.

721
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,339
See, Rory is my daughter.

722
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:48,926
- Here comes the talk.
- How about I talk, you listen?

723
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:52,013
Rory is a smart kid.
She's never been much for guys.

724
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:53,806
The fact that she likes you means a lot.

725
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,267
I don't believe she'd waste her time
with some loser.

726
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,393
But you're watching me.

727
00:39:57,476 --> 00:40:00,271
Sweetheart, the whole town
is watching you.

728
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:03,316
That girl in there is beloved around here.

729
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:08,029
You hurt her, there's not a safe place
within a hundred miles for you to hide.

730
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:11,073
This is a very small,
weird place you moved to.

731
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:12,575
I've noticed.

732
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:15,286
So, just know all eyes are on you.

733
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,122
Anything else?

734
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:21,334
- She's not going on your motorcycle.
- I don't have a motorcycle.

735
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:25,421
- She's not going on your motorcycle.
- Fine. She won't go on my motorcycle.

736
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:28,591
Curfew will be enforced.
You will not detract from her schoolwork.

737
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:30,468
You'll start handling those lemons better.

738
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:32,678
- What?
- Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.

739
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:36,974
I reserve the right to change, alter, tweak,
or add to the list of rules at any time...

740
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:39,769
without any written notice. Am I clear?

741
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,479
You're clear.

742
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:44,148
- Good.
- My turn to speak?

743
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,942
Fine. Go ahead.

744
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:49,820
You can lay on all the rules you want.

745
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,615
You can have the whole town spy on me...

746
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:55,326
and stare at me,
and chase me through the streets.

747
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,578
I like the
"chase you through the streets" idea.

748
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:59,997
I just want you to know
that I'm not going anywhere.

749
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,168
- It's gonna be a short chase then, isn't it?
- I need you not to hate me.

750
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,421
If you hate me,
then I don't have a shot in hell with Rory.

751
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:09,840
- Rory has her own mind.
- But you're her best friend.

752
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:13,511
What you think means everything to her,
and you know that.

753
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,265
I want to like you, 'cause Rory likes you.

754
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:21,519
- But you don't.
- I want to.

755
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,021
And I usually get what I want.

756
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:27,525
Fair enough.

757
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,991
She's taking a long time on her face.

758
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:38,327
Yeah, well, Rory is a perfectionist.

759
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:42,581
Let's do it again, Mr. Wonka.

760
00:41:43,624 --> 00:41:45,543
Tell your mom thanks for inviting me.

761
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:47,545
I'm sorry if this was totally weird.

762
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:52,216
- With my mom inviting you over...
- No. It was good, really.

763
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:54,510
- Really?
- Yeah.

764
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:07,231
Thank you.

765
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:21,745
So, that went well.

766
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,914
Yeah, not bad.

767
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,292
Did I humiliate you?

768
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:30,588
I don't know. What did you say to him
when I went to the bathroom?

769
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:32,381
That you're pretty.

770
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,842
- Liar.
- Yeah, well...

771
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,929
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Okay.

772
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:47,396
- Mom, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

773
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,524
Yes, there is. Come on. Tell me.

774
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:52,193
Nothing.

775
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,865
I really wanted you
to tell me about that kiss.

776
00:42:57,948 --> 00:43:00,576
I'm so sorry. I really wanted to, I swear.

777
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:03,621
- I just got scared and...
- I know. I'm not mad.

778
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:07,124
I just wanted to hear about it. That's all.

779
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,003
It's no big deal. It's okay. I'm fine.

780
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:13,964
It's one too many Caramello bars.
I'm sorry.

781
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:17,426
You have school, I have work.
So time for bed.

782
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:20,471
- Okay. Good night.
- Okay. Good night, hon.

783
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,642
Mom?

784
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:28,228
I know this is lame
and totally after the fact, but...

785
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:32,441
Start at the beginning.
And you leave anything out, you die.

786
00:43:32,524 --> 00:43:36,070
- Where were you?
- I was in the aisle where the ant spray is.

787
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,572
- That's a good aisle.
- That's what Lane said, too.

788
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:41,325
But, anyway, so he was working,
and I go into the store...

789
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:46,038
and I just kind of walked around
pretending to shop for food or whatever...
