1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,048
Tomorrow our lawyer, Joseph Stanford,
is coming by.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,219
- Crazy Sissy's dad.
- That's terrible. You were good friends.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,596
She spoke to her stuffed animals,
and they answered.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,973
- Let's start a new topic.
- You're impossible.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,099
She said a new topic.

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,477
Everything's a joke.
Everyone's a punch line.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,811
Okay, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,480
My daughter, Henny Youngman.

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,900
Sorry for that.
A little trouble in our China office.

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,818
Well, what did I miss?

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,697
I was being impossible.
Then I turned into a Jewish comedian.

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,867
- Continue.
- Thank you. Where was I?

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,370
Joseph Stanford is coming tomorrow.

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,749
Yes. So, Rory, your grandfather and I
thought it might be nice after dinner...

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,670
to go around the house and pick out
what you'd like us to leave you in our will.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,465
Take a look at that desk in my office.
It's a really fine Georgian piece.

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,301
Why don't I ever bring a tape recorder
to these dinners?

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,053
Anything you want to leave me is fine.

19
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,223
Nonsense. You should have what you like.
Just look around.

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,767
When you see something you like,
stick a Post-it on it.

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,813
Okay, you two have officially hit
a new level of weird that even I marvel at.

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,899
- You can pick out things, too.
- Now it's way less creepy.

23
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,485
Did you hear that, Richard?
Apparently we're creepy.

24
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,570
Yes, well, you live and learn.

25
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,073
- Oh, cool.
- What's that?

26
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,242
- It's dessert.
- It's pudding.

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,411
If you knew what it was, why did you ask?

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,622
- You don't like pudding.
- Yes, but you like pudding.

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,833
I love pudding. I worship it.

30
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,501
I have a bowl up on the mantel...

31
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,170
with the Virgin Mary, a glass of wine,
and $1 next to it.

32
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,548
I've never had pudding
from a crystal bowl before.

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
You like the bowl?

34
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,428
Put a Post-it on it when you're done.

35
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,158
So, what do we think of this?

36
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,702
- Where would we put it?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,705
The Emily and Richard Gilmore
Psycho Museum?

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,541
This is the strangest evening
I've ever spent here.

39
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,918
So, how are we doing?

40
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,670
Great. Just getting ready for the big day.

41
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,590
- Very nice.
- It's getting late, Mom.

42
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,260
Unless you've got some funeral plots
for us to decorate, we should be going.

43
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,804
Any special requests
for dinner next week?

44
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
Mom, I want to talk to you for a minute.

45
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,769
And, Rory, why don't you
go say goodbye to Grandpa?

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,229
Very smooth.

47
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,190
Shall I sit down?

48
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,276
Yeah, but not there, okay?
We got a Post-it on that.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,070
We'd like to keep it nice.

50
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,364
It must be very exhausting to be you.

51
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,450
- Mom, Rory's birthday is next Friday.
- I know that.

52
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,537
So, we were thinking maybe we could
push our dinner next week to Saturday.

53
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,915
- What're you going to do on Friday?
- I don't know...

54
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,833
Come here, and we'll have a little party.

55
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,295
- Can we do it another night?
- Why another night when her birthday is...

56
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,047
on the exact night that you come here.

57
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,383
- Saturday's a good night.
- Not as good as Friday.

58
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,468
- Pretty close.
- Not from where I'm standing.

59
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,886
Move then.

60
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,265
I'm sorry. Friday nights are my nights.

61
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,893
That's what we agreed on
when you borrowed money for her school.

62
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,981
I didn't intend for this loan to become
a constant source of blackmail, okay?

63
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,692
This is my kid's birthday,
and she will have her party...

64
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,819
at home on Friday, and that's it.

65
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,362
End of story.

66
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,117
So, how would you like two parties
this year?

67
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,202
- You couldn't get her to cave.
- No.

68
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,289
But she did agree to make
the string quartet learn Like a Virgin.

69
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,540
Well, you tried.

70
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,377
Sweetie, I promise, Saturday night
we'll do it up right at home.

71
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,462
A Stars Hollow extravaganza.

72
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,424
So, is this party Grandma's having
going to be a big deal?

73
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,842
Not really.

74
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,179
The government will close that day.
Flags will fly at half-mast.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,474
Barbra Streisand
will give her final concert again.

76
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,644
The Pope has previous plans,
but he's trying to get out of them.

77
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,605
However, Elvis and Jim Morrison
are coming...

78
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,359
- and they're bringing chips.
- You ask a simple question...

79
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,989
Mini orange biscuits with
honey-mustard ham and cheddar cheese.

80
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,992
- Angel wings with dipping sauce.
- Good.

81
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,077
- Did you bring me the picture?
- Yes.

82
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,830
Too bad you couldn't get your mom
to relinquish Friday.

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,333
- She has her Vulcan death grip on that.
- Not that surprising though.

84
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,128
Emily Gilmore.
You could set your watch by her.

85
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,672
- You know what she did do last night?
- Wore jeans.

86
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,799
- Served pudding.
- I was close.

87
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,052
I'm sure it was some
expensive form of pudding...

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,678
but nonetheless, it was pudding!

89
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,388
- That is amazing.
- Right?

90
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,683
That would mean that she made
a mental note that we liked pudding.

91
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,311
Which means that she listened
to something other than...

92
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,564
the judgmental conga line in her head,
and got over the fact that...

93
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,150
to her, pudding is hospital food,
and only acceptable...

94
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,444
when you've just had
a vital organ ripped out.

95
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,280
That's some journey she had to take there.

96
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,366
- Open your mouth and close your eyes.
- Who are you talking to?

97
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,659
Right, sorry.

98
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,287
- Open your mouth and close your eyes.
- Okay.

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,998
Get ready for something truly amazing.

100
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,420
- What is it?
- I don't know.

101
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,380
- It's like a...
- A what?

102
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,343
- It's like a berry, but way more exotic.
- Yes. Good.

103
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,262
Have you been having reactions
to your fertilizer fumes again?

104
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,182
For some time now
I've been toying with cross-pollination.

105
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,391
Finally, I've got it.

106
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,812
I figured out a way
to cross a raspberry with a kumquat.

107
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,272
- Kumquat! That's what I taste!
- Are you serious?

108
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,649
How did you do this?

109
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,193
You didn't build a machine
like in The Fly, did you?

110
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,239
Will we find you wandering the streets
with a raspberry head crying, "Eat me!"

111
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,406
You!

112
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,078
You can make fun of me all you want to,
because today I am a god.

113
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,414
Today Mother Nature
has bowed down to me!

114
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,250
How nice for her.

115
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,002
- Michel, Jackson...
- No need to fill me in.

116
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,547
I'm quite happy being ignorant
of whatever it is...

117
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,174
that is making him raise his arms
over his head.

118
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,885
- Do you need me?
- The landscaper does.

119
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,223
Rory's birthday party is Saturday night.

120
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,934
So start thinking up reasons
why you can't come.

121
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,687
- I'm going to be out of town.
- You used that last year.

122
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,732
- I'll work on it and get back to you.
- 7:00. Presents mandatory.

123
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,776
Rasquat?

124
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,238
- Lucy, I'm home!
- Kitchen.

125
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,449
'And Justin is just so dreamy.
He can't marry Britney.

126
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,451
"I'll just cry, cry, and cry."

127
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,953
Okay, thanks.

128
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,999
- Pizza's on its way.
- You're such a good provider.

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,462
I'm gonna go start my homework.
Call me when the pizza guy gets here.

130
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,137
- Hello?
- Lorelai, what is your work schedule?

131
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,347
- Why?
- I want to go shopping.

132
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,225
- With me?
- I think that goes without saying.

133
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,228
- Only in your world.
- I want to get Rory a birthday present.

134
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,272
I'm sure whatever you get her, she'll love.

135
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,524
I want to get her something special.

136
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,985
Something that you would get her.

137
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay, fine. You can get her the bong then.

138
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,908
This isn't funny. I hardly see the girl.
We only get to talk at dinner once a week.

139
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,328
And then it's all about school, and Jane.

140
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,412
Lane, Mom.

141
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,790
I thought you might let me into
your secret club just this one time...

142
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,251
and help me buy her something
for her birthday.

143
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,337
- You're serious?
- According to you, I'm always serious.

144
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,340
- Okay?
- Okay.

145
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,009
Well, good.

146
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,386
I'll meet you at Damion's,
tomorrow at 3:00.

147
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
Okay.

148
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,515
- And dress...
- Don't finish that sentence, Mom.

149
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,602
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Attagirl.

150
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,446
- What, Tristan?
- I wanted to say, "Happy birthday."

151
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,365
- It's not my birthday.
- No, but it will be.

152
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,827
"On Friday at 4:03
in the morning, Lorelai..."

153
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,370
What is that?

154
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,209
Who else got these?

155
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,212
I don't know.
Everyone in our class, I think.

156
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,672
I have to go.

157
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
I'll see you Friday, birthday girl.

158
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,930
That's her.

159
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,015
My parents are making me go.

160
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,310
- Another obligation party.
- My life stinks.

161
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,486
- Isn't this lovely?
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,031
As soon as we have her crowned
Queen of England, we'll give it to her.

163
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,535
- You are so combative today.
- Hot weather does that to me.

164
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,621
Mom, look. This is good.

165
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,414
What is that?

166
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,834
It's a purse shaped like a guitar.
This is great.

167
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,252
- Great for what?
- For Rory.

168
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,255
- What would Rory do with this?
- Put stuff in it and carry it.

169
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,673
- In public?
- Yes.

170
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,718
- What would people think?
- That she's an ax murderer, of course.

171
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,764
What about pearls?

172
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,058
Pearls?

173
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,936
A double string of pearls
with a cashmere sweater set.

174
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,231
Mom, she's a young girl.
Think of something young.

175
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,733
A Montblanc pen?

176
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,403
- To put on her desk at the law firm?
- She needs to write.

177
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,863
Not with a $200 pen, she doesn't.

178
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,493
Oh, hey, look.

179
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,162
These day planners are adorable.

180
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,874
You could get her the funky eraser
with the mermaid on it. She'll love that.

181
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,127
Please be serious.
We're shopping for Rory.

182
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,298
I'm shopping for her. You're shopping for
an imaginary grandchild, Barbara Hutton.

183
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,799
I want to get her something nice.

184
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,176
You asked for my help,
but you're not listening.

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,013
You wanted me to get her a Filofax
and a mermaid eraser.

186
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,472
- It's one suggestion.
- Yes.

187
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,766
And the T-shirt
with the Farrah Fawcett face.

188
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,270
A hero to many
who aspire to the perfect feather flip.

189
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,939
I don't know how to do this. Let's just go.

190
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,359
No. Come on, Mom.
You do know how to do this.

191
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,194
Think pudding.

192
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,946
Pudding?

193
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,157
Come on, you asked for my help.

194
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,493
You're reaching out. A little, not a lot.
Don't get freaked.

195
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,163
- But, Mom, pudding.
- Why do you keep saying "pudding"?

196
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,208
Just look around and pick up something
you think she might like.

197
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,135
Here.

198
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,888
Now, that's really good.

199
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,348
- Really?
- Absolutely.

200
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,641
Looks like something
you could buy at a car wash?

201
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,477
Totally. That's half the charm.

202
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,730
- Oh, no, it's only $12.
- $6 more than a car wash.

203
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,607
$12 is not a present.

204
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,777
$12 is a perfect present, Mom.
She'll love that.

205
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,864
Can I at least get her the pashmina also?

206
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,618
- Fine, i'll get it.
- Good choice.

207
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,912
It lights up.

208
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,212
She's not here yet.

209
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,215
All right. You'll have to entertain me
until she arrives.

210
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,008
Okay, burger boy, dance.

211
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,177
- Will you marry me?
- What?

212
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,055
Just looking for something to shut you up.

213
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,307
Better be nice to me,
or I'm not inviting you...

214
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,227
to Rory Gilmore's birthday celebration
this Saturday night.

215
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,062
You don't have to ask me, you know.

216
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,689
I know. But I would like you to come.

217
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,149
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

218
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,694
- Okay, i'll see.
- 7:00. Don't be late.

219
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,077
Wow, nice face you got on there.

220
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,205
- Coffee.
- Bad day?

221
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,708
I've now used the word "suck" so much
that it's lost all meaning to me.

222
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,669
Maybe this will cheer you up.

223
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,629
- What?
- You'll see.

224
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,011
- What is that?
- These are our party dresses.

225
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,972
So it's a Halloween party?

226
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,433
Listen, you. So I'm shopping today
with your grandmother...

227
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,062
and it's a whole three hours of,
"Who are you buying that for, Mom?"

228
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:14,108
"Have you met Rory?" And then finally
I talked and she listened.

229
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,278
She wound up getting you something
I think you're gonna like.

230
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,779
- Really?
- Yes, really.

231
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,031
And she insisted on
buying us these dresses.

232
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,450
But I think I can do something
to make them better.

233
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,954
I've never seen you so cheery
after spending time with Grandma.

234
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,791
It's been a long time since we got together
and didn't end up fighting.

235
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,252
It was refreshing. It wasn't exactly fun...

236
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:37,047
but I didn't get that shooting pain
in my eye like I usually do.

237
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,799
- That's great.
- Yeah.

238
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,843
So I hear you're having a party Saturday.

239
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,012
Yeah. Mom's famous for her blowouts.

240
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,889
- The best one was her eighth birthday.
- Yeah, that was good.

241
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,059
- The cops shut us down.
- Shut down an 8-year-old's birthday party?

242
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,769
And arrested the clown.

243
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,480
I don't want to hear any more of this.

244
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,985
So now tell me,
why Miss Lemonhead today?

245
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,404
Nothing. I'm fine.

246
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,116
I just got an A-minus on a French test
that I should have gotten an A on.

247
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,161
Honey, an A-minus is awesome.

248
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,413
Yeah, it's fine.

249
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,041
Let me see.

250
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,544
Maybe we should really embrace
the whole tulle thing.

251
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,505
Go totally modern Cinderella.
What do you think?

252
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,341
It's your birthday.

253
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,468
Yeah, lucky me.

254
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,362
Happy birthday, little girl.

255
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,796
I can't believe how fast you're growing up.

256
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,047
Really?

257
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,385
- Feels slow.
- Trust me, it's fast.

258
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,223
- What do you think of your life so far?
- I think it's pretty good.

259
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,058
Any complaints?

260
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,187
I'd like that whole humidity thing
to go away.

261
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,564
All right. I'll work on that.

262
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,149
So, do I look older?

263
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,568
Oh, yeah.

264
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,155
You walk into Denny's before 5:00,
you've got yourself a discount.

265
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,573
Good deal.

266
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,743
- So, you know what I think?
- What?

267
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:35,124
I think you're a great, cool kid,
and the best friend a girl could have.

268
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,625
Back at you.

269
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,630
And it's so hard to believe
that at exactly this time...

270
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:45,676
many moons ago,
I was lying in exactly the same position...

271
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,220
Oh, boy, here we go.

272
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,015
Only I had a huge, fat stomach,
and big, fat ankles.

273
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,934
And I was swearing like a sailor...

274
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,520
- On leave.
- On leave, right.

275
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,690
- And there I was...
- In labor.

276
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:04,278
And while some have called it the most
meaningful experience of your life...

277
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,948
to me it was
something more akin to doing the splits...

278
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,783
on a crate of dynamite.

279
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,160
I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.

280
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,122
And I was screaming and swearing...

281
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,751
and being surrounded as I was
by a hundred prominent doctors...

282
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,255
I just assumed there was an actual use...

283
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,300
- for the cup of ice chips they gave me.
- There wasn't.

284
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,303
But pelting the nurses sure was fun.

285
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,306
I love you, Mom.

286
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,142
We're getting to the part
where he sees your head.

287
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,020
So there I was, lying...

288
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,647
You shouldn't have to go to school today.

289
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,483
- I have to. Latin test.
- Jeez. Every day you have a test.

290
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,819
Do you have time to learn anything
to be tested on?

291
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
- Wrong table.
- Since when is there a right table?

292
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:52,075
Since the coffee cake I baked for you,
and the stupid balloons I blew up...

293
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,369
are at that table, over there.

294
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,872
- You blew up balloons for me?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,665
Luke, you old softy.

296
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,501
- I count to three, it's gone.
- Thank you.

297
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,759
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

298
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm getting old, Lane.

299
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,682
- You seem a little quiet this morning.
- I'm just dreading this whole night.

300
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,311
It's bad enough that I have to see
these stupid kids from Chilton every day.

301
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,480
But tonight, on my birthday?

302
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,690
I've never even talked to most of them.

303
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,361
I've only been going to this school
for a couple of months.

304
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,280
God, they're gonna think
I am the biggest freak.

305
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,033
That I need my grandma
to get people to come to my party.

306
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,160
What did Lorelai say when you told her?

307
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,953
- I didn't.
- Why not?

308
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:41,375
- Because of the pudding.
- Right, I forgot about the pudding.

309
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,293
Grandma served us pudding
the other night.

310
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,546
Then she went shopping with my mom,
and they didn't fight.

311
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,217
I mean, they never get along.
And now, suddenly, they're getting along.

312
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,304
I knew that if I told Mom about the invite,
she'd wig out and call Grandma...

313
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,348
and that would be the end of the pudding.

314
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,642
You know, you can buy pudding.

315
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,436
- It's one night, right?
- Right.

316
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,772
I can stand it for one night.

317
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,449
Coffee to go, please.

318
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,170
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

319
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,808
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm just thinking about pudding.

320
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,603
No, not there. In the living room.

321
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,273
Why are you touching that?

322
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,316
- I was just...
- Well, don't!

323
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,194
I want those 6 inches apart. Get a ruler.

324
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,822
- Emily.
- Let me do that.

325
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,116
I hope the Larsons are coming tonight.

326
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,244
Richard, no business.
This is your granddaughter's party.

327
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,997
Five minutes of shoptalk
won't spoil the evening.

328
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,790
- Five minutes, please.
- Emily...

329
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,419
If I ever heard you keep your shoptalk
down to five minutes, I'd drop dead.

330
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,130
I could drop dead,
and you wouldn't stop talking business.

331
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,757
You'd just step over my body
to get to the speakerphone.

332
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,302
- What?
- You look very nice tonight.

333
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:17,804
Thank you.

334
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,817
Jeez, Mom, leave some servants
for the rest of the neighborhood.

335
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,945
- There she is, the birthday girl.
- Hi, Grandma.

336
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,989
Wow, you really went all out.

337
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,450
I wanted everything to be perfect.
What do you think?

338
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,703
Edith Wharton would have been proud,
and busy taking notes.

339
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,663
- Here, babe, go change.
- Okay.

340
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,873
Hurry.

341
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,044
- What is that?
- That's my dress.

342
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,296
- Where's the one I bought you?
- This is it.

343
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,756
I thought there was more of it.

344
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,009
- Mom, the place looks great.
- Did you turn Rory's into a hat?

345
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,261
Nice candles. 6 inches apart?

346
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,519
You're drinking white wine tonight?
No Scotch?

347
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,817
Excuse me. I'm going to sit over there
with my daughter.

348
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,654
Here.

349
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,864
- What is it?
- Shirley Temple.

350
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,409
- What are you drinking?
- A Shirley Temple Black.

351
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,165
I got your Good Ship Lollipop
right here, mister.

352
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,876
So, do you want something to eat?

353
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,753
Everything smells funny.

354
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,548
There you are. Come.
There's some people I want you to meet.

355
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,595
- Lorelai?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,016
Oh, my God! Oh, Mitzi,
wow, I haven't seen you since...

357
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,267
Your seventh month.

358
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,353
I was gonna say high school, but okay.

359
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,522
- Oh, no. Did I say something rude?
- No.

360
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:53,900
No, I did. I said something rude.
I've been trying to work on that.

361
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,193
Well, a noble goal.

362
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,321
Ever since my divorce,
I've been really trying to work on myself.

363
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,573
I just... I want to grow.

364
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,621
Lorelai Gilmore, the scandal girl.

365
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,374
Now, tell me,
what ever happened with Christopher?

366
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,544
- Christopher is in California.
- Do you hear from him?

367
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:15,130
I'm sorry,
is this painful for you to talk about?

368
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,923
When did he last call you?

369
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,050
You're making progress
with that rude thing.

370
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,469
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

371
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,472
He calls, like, once a week.
And we see him at Christmas...

372
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,975
sometimes Easter. It's all very civil.

373
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,395
- So are you married now?
- No, it's just me and Rory.

374
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,273
- Your cat?
- My kid. She's right over there.

375
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,778
You can really see Christopher in her,
can't you?

376
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,156
- Yes, you can.
- Does that kill you?

377
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,743
You know what? I see someone else,
and it's been great.

378
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,789
- No, those aren't the terms we agreed on.
- They most certainly are.

379
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,584
You were at the same meeting as I was.

380
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,628
We spelled out a five-year extension,
not a three-year one.

381
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,921
I heard three.

382
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,257
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Rory.

383
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,759
Gentlemen, this is
my granddaughter, Rory.

384
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,636
Happy birthday, Rory.

385
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,306
I think we should get Dennis
on the phone right now.

386
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,892
Fine, I've got a phone in my office.

387
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,566
Rory, there's a group
of your school friends in the library.

388
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,276
Let's go say hello to them.

389
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,701
I have to go to the bathroom.

390
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,205
Just say hello first.
Come on, i'll hold those for you.

391
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,375
- Who's that?
- I think it's her party.

392
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:41,633
Paris?

393
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,886
- My parents made me come.
- Oh, God!

394
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,138
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

395
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,307
You believe me, don't you?

396
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,893
Oh, coming to greet me?

397
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,229
Hello, Tristan.

398
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,315
- So where's my birthday kiss?
- It's my birthday.

399
00:21:57,398 --> 00:22:00,276
- So i'll give you a birthday kiss.
- What is wrong with you?

400
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,236
Okay, I gotta tell you something.

401
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,073
- I'm madly in love with you.
- Well, good luck with that.

402
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,033
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

403
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:11,204
I wake up in the middle of the night
calling out your name. Rory.

404
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,747
Would you shut up please?

405
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,208
Rory, who's your friend?

406
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,211
- I don't know, but this is Tristan.
- Excuse me?

407
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,588
- Tristan Dugray, sir.
- Dugray?

408
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,634
- Are you any relation to Janlen Dugray?
- That's my grandfather, sir.

409
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:27,220
I've done business with Janlen for years.

410
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,138
- He's a fine man.
- That he is.

411
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,100
You have very good taste in friends.
I approve.

412
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:36,312
Richard, I've got Dennis on the phone
and he heard the same thing I heard.

413
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,482
Well, one wrong man
can always find a friend.

414
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,943
- He likes me.
- He's drunk.

415
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,444
Let's take a walk.

416
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,780
This is stupid. You don't even like me.

417
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:48,574
You have this weird need to prove
that i'll go out with you.

418
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,992
That's not liking someone.

419
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:53,204
Why are you fighting this?
You're gonna give in eventually.

420
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,789
I'm gonna go find my mother.

421
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,749
Wow, meeting your mom.

422
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,669
It's a bit sudden, but okay, I'm ready.

423
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:06,926
There you are.

424
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,554
I think it's time you said
a few words to your guests.

425
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,723
- What?
- Just a little speech to say thank you...

426
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,016
and tell everyone how it feels
to be a year older.

427
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,102
- I don't think...
- She's the hostess.

428
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,147
- This is her responsibility.
- I am not the hostess. You are.

429
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,314
Honey, hold on.

430
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,525
This is your party,
and these are your guests.

431
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:26,696
I don't have anything to say to them.
So you give the speech. Excuse me.

432
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,616
What was that all about?

433
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,119
Lorelai, your daughter
has no manners whatsoever.

434
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,246
You should be ashamed of yourself.

435
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,208
How did this become my fault?

436
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,807
- Can I come in?
- It's your room.

437
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,601
How are you doing?

438
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,730
I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma.

439
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:04,358
That was a pretty Freaky Friday moment
we had back there.

440
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,945
She just went ahead
and invited all those kids from Chilton.

441
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,781
You're kidding.
I thought she checked on that with you.

442
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:14,660
- She didn't ask me or tell me.
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

443
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:18,623
I don't know, but it really made me mad.

444
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,710
- Honey, why didn't you tell me?
- Because you were happy.

445
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:26,380
It's not often
that there's peace between you two.

446
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,049
I didn't want to screw everything up.

447
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,343
I appreciate you wanting
Mom and I to get along...

448
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,261
but you shouldn't keep such stuff from me.

449
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,890
I feel terrible.
I mean, I've never yelled at her before.

450
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,477
Listen, you'll apologize.
All will be forgotten.

451
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,520
You'll see.

452
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,862
It's like time has stood still in this room.

453
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,365
It must be weird
for you to be in this room now.

454
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:55,368
It was weird for me
to be in this room then.

455
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:59,997
You know,
they gave this to me with the glass on.

456
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:03,542
I now officially know what it feels like
to have grown up here.

457
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:07,338
It's not official until you're huddled
in a corner, eating your hair.

458
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:11,217
Do you remember your last birthday here?

459
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:16,305
We had just had a fight, and I was
lying on the bed just like you are now.

460
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,057
What did you fight about?

461
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,396
- I was pregnant.
- That.

462
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:28,818
And I said something at the table
about the pate smelling like Clorox...

463
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:32,071
and one thing led to another,
and I wound up here.

464
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:37,118
They hadn't told anybody yet
about me and you.

465
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:41,872
- That must have been really hard on them.
- Yeah.

466
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:45,042
I remember when I finally told them...

467
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:48,295
it was the only time
they ever looked small to me.

468
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,759
- I guess I'd better go find Grandma.
- Give her a minute...

469
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,595
- There you are.
...she'll find us.

470
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,433
You are both being very rude.
This isn't my birthday party, you know.

471
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:03,227
- Sorry, Mom.
- Honestly, the way the two of you act.

472
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,398
- Grandma, I just want to say...
- We'll talk about this later. Now go.

473
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:14,113
Thank you. Good to see you.

474
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:15,948
Lovely as always, Leeza.

475
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,076
My best to Darren.

476
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,461
Great party. One of your best.

477
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:31,422
I even liked
those brown mushroom things.

478
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,716
Grandma, can I talk to you for a sec?

479
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,468
Richard, the girls are leaving.

480
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:41,015
- Rory, I hope you had a good time.
- Yeah, I did.

481
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,059
I know your grandmother
has already bought you a gift...

482
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,519
and signed my name to it.

483
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,147
That was part of our agreement
when we got married.

484
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,818
However, I feel this occasion
calls for something a little extra.

485
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:55,362
Put that towards your trip to Fez.

486
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:59,408
- Oh, Grandpa.
- You're a good girl, Rory. Happy birthday.

487
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,039
- I don't deserve this.
- Fine. Hand it over.

488
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,708
You should get going.
You've got quite a drive ahead.

489
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,836
Grandma, we're having a party tomorrow
at our house.

490
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,255
It won't be anything like this...

491
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:15,841
but it will be fun.
Maybe you and Grandpa could come.

492
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,761
That's very sweet,
but I'm afraid we already have plans.

493
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,305
- Okay.
- Have a safe trip.

494
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,766
Lock the door behind you.

495
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,148
Why don't you go help that guy out there
put all the presents in the car?

496
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,820
All this can go in the dishwasher.

497
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:40,407
- Mom, come to the party tomorrow.
- I can't. I'm busy.

498
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,618
Throw those out. We won't eat them.

499
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:46,914
Your granddaughter invited you
to her birthday party. Please come.

500
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,375
I've already been to a party
for my granddaughter...

501
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,710
and she humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

502
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:54,213
I have no desire to relive that experience.

503
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:56,715
The cheeses must be
put in individual bags.

504
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:58,133
Mom, come on. Give her a break.

505
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:00,761
You invited all these Chilton kids
without asking her.

506
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:03,597
They're her schoolmates.
I assumed they were her friends.

507
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,058
You know what they say
when people assume things.

508
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,142
No, what do they say?

509
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:10,396
- That you shouldn't.
- Very clever.

510
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:13,440
Mom, she didn't want them here.
She doesn't like them.

511
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:14,733
I had to invite them.

512
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:17,736
That's good manners,
something your daughter is sorely lacking.

513
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,864
You're doing the same thing to her
that you always did to me.

514
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:24,118
You try to control her.
When that doesn't work you shut her out.

515
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:26,203
I'm too tired for your accusations
right now.

516
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,706
Can we do this tomorrow?
I'll find you a pen...

517
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:31,542
so you can write down your insults
so you won't forget them.

518
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,920
This is not funny.
I have a crushed kid out in the car.

519
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,255
What do you want me to say?

520
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,300
Everything's fine. It's forgotten.
There. I'll see you next week.

521
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:43,095
So I guess the whole pudding thing
was just a fluke, huh?

522
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,556
Trying to get to know us,
easing up on the rules...

523
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:49,226
smudging that bottom line of yours.
It was just some weird phase.

524
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,520
You were on cold medicine
last week or something?

525
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:55,357
Oh, so I'm a villain now, is that it?
I spent a fortune on this party.

526
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:58,652
I spent days planning it,
making sure every detail was perfect...

527
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,280
the food, the linen, the music.
I did all this for Rory.

528
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:02,614
That's not what she needed.

529
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:05,034
What she needs is
for you to accept her apology...

530
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:07,161
and come to her party.
That's what she needs.

531
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,246
- You don't care what she needs.
- How dare you?

532
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:11,874
You don't know what she needs
'cause you don't know her.

533
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:14,418
You've never tried to know her,
like you never knew me.

534
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,587
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me.

535
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,840
You'd like to think that.
That you're some huge mystery?

536
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,050
"Why does Lorelai do that?"

537
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,760
"I don't know. She's a mystery to me."

538
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,846
- You're not so mysterious, Lorelai.
- No. What am I then?

539
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,266
Right now you're very loud and disruptive
to the cleaning process.

540
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:32,978
What do I have to do to get you to put
the damn cheese in individual bags?

541
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,271
Fine. I give up.

542
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,815
If I had a dollar
for every time you gave up...

543
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,985
Then you could pay for this party,
couldn't you?

544
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,787
I made coffee.

545
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,498
Hangover?

546
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:55,959
- Emily.
- Got it. Moving on.

547
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:00,672
- Good morning.
- Morning, popcorn.

548
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:03,300
- You want some pancakes?
- No, I've gotta get going.

549
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,594
- Where?
- The college fair is today.

550
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,763
So you're going to get
another Harvard brochure?

551
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,015
I just wanna see
if they've changed the pictures.

552
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:11,099
Weirdo.

553
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:13,519
I'll be back in plenty of time
to help you decorate.

554
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:15,312
This is your party. You do not work.

555
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,981
You mock those who are.
Have I taught you nothing?

556
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:21,610
- Sorry. I'll try to be better. Bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

557
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,162
- New brochure?
- Yes.

558
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,629
- What are you doing here?
- There's a college fair going on.

559
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:45,217
- No. I mean what are you doing here?
- I'm getting a new brochure.

560
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,928
- Why?
- Because they're not selling pizza.

561
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:52,099
- Oh, no.
- You can't.

562
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,685
- You're applying to Harvard?
- Yes.

563
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,604
Ten generations of Gellers
have gone to Harvard.

564
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,189
I have to go to Harvard.

565
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,775
- I can't believe this.
- You can go somewhere else.

566
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,403
Go to Brandeis. Brandeis is nice.

567
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,072
I've only ever wanted to go to Harvard.

568
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,241
That's it. Nowhere else.

569
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,206
- It's a big school.
- I guess.

570
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,418
- We'll probably never see each other.
- You think?

571
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,170
- Lf we do, we duck.
- Okay.

572
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:38,145
- Are you dating Tristan?
- What? No way.

573
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:43,150
- Do you like him?
- Not even a little.

574
00:31:43,984 --> 00:31:45,652
- Really?
- Really.

575
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:58,790
- Nice party.
- Thanks.

576
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:16,683
Hi, everybody. Happy birthday, Rory.

577
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,143
Oh, my God.

578
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,192
Open it.

579
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,612
- No!
- Do you like it?

580
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,324
- You can take it back.
- No, I love it.

581
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,951
- It's perfect.
- It's blue, and it has a handle.

582
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,204
- It's way too expensive.
- I know.

583
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:41,833
- That's what I told the guy at the store.
- On three, 'cause I'm gonna drop it.

584
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,460
One, two...

585
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:00,352
Make a wish.

586
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:11,738
All right, everybody, I need your attention.
Attention, please.

587
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:14,199
This is a very serious moment.

588
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,204
Two priests, a rabbi, and a duck...

589
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:21,623
- Mom.
- All right, I'm kidding.

590
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:25,335
I would like to propose a toast...

591
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:28,588
to the one thing in my life
that is always good...

592
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,507
always sweet...

593
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:34,427
and without whom I would have
no reason to get up in the morning.

594
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,763
My pal Rory. Cheers.

595
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:39,808
Here's to you, birthday girl.

596
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,018
And in honor of this very special girl...

597
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,479
I now invite you all
to help me eat her face.

598
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,315
And you may have the first cut.

599
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,860
There's something very strange
about hacking into my own head.

600
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:55,031
Jeez, who the hell's ringing the bell?
It's a party. Get your ass in here.

601
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,786
Or asses I guess.

602
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:09,129
Grandma, Grandpa...

603
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:13,049
I can't believe you're here.
I'm so glad you came.

604
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:16,761
- Hey, no tie?
- I thought I'd mix it up a little.

605
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:19,973
- Grandma, look.
- Why, it looks lovely.

606
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:23,560
I want you to meet everyone.
Everyone, these are my grandparents.

607
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,691
Lorelai, you look well.

608
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:31,276
I'm Patricia Lacosta.

609
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,778
We just love your daughter
and granddaughter.

610
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,071
Thank you.

611
00:34:35,113 --> 00:34:37,824
My God, you're a tall specimen of a man.

612
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,285
Must be all that good air in Hartford.

613
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,496
Mom, Dad, can I get you a drink?

614
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,457
- No, thank you.
- You're gonna need one.

615
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,460
I have wine glasses that say
"Holiday Inn" on them.

616
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:51,463
- Stoli on the rocks with a twist.
- Right.

617
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,634
- My parents are here.
- No.

618
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:01,431
I've cursed in front of them twice,
Miss Patty tried to hit on my dad...

619
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:04,059
and I'm sure Mom's gonna call
Child Protective Services.

620
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,103
- When was the last time they were here?
- Never.

621
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:09,814
- Not once?
- Not since we moved here.

622
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:13,068
They'd come down and visit us
occasionally when Rory was a baby...

623
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,613
and we lived at the Inn,
but they have never been here.

624
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,240
That's big stuff. Is Rory thrilled?

625
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:21,242
- Through the roof.
- Oh, that's great.

626
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,496
Lorelai, I just tried
some of those hors d'oeuvres.

627
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,747
They're unbelievable.

628
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,665
- Who is your caterer?
- Sookie.

629
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:29,542
- What's a Sookie?
- That's a Sookie.

630
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:32,796
- Hi, Sookie St. James.
- Sookie's the chef at the Inn, Mom.

631
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:36,091
- My dear, you are very talented.
- Thank you.

632
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,469
You must cater my next party.
When my friends get wind of you...

633
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:42,347
you'll have so much business,
you won't know what to do.

634
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:44,265
But remember, I discovered you.

635
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:47,727
Mom, Sookie has a job.
She's the chef at the Inn.

636
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:52,649
The Inn where we work.

637
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:54,484
My Inn.

638
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:57,654
Six days a week, Mom.
She cooks there every day.

639
00:35:57,695 --> 00:36:00,907
Just give her your number
or we'll never get out of here.

640
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:08,915
- So, how does it look?
- It doesn't look structurally sound.

641
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,335
Drink up, Dad.

642
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,631
Okay, don't panic.

643
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,092
- Good opening line. What's wrong?
- We're out of ice.

644
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:20,343
How can we be out of ice?

645
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,846
We had a ton.
It was like a penguin habitat in there.

646
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,097
I don't know how it happened.

647
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,141
I just know it happened.
Somehow we have to deal with it.

648
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:29,352
I will go and get some then.

649
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:38,945
Oh, my God. You're a vision!

650
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:42,240
- Sookie, we have ice.
- Hallelujah.

651
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,825
How did you know?

652
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:46,744
A good rule of thumb is
you can never have too much ice.

653
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,788
You're the best!

654
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,460
Hi, Mom. This is my friend Luke.

655
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:56,963
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you.

656
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,966
I'd better get these in the freezer
before they melt.

657
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,010
Not very likely in here.

658
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:16,107
- Rory, what a lovely party.
- I brought you something to read.

659
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:18,151
It's not The Wall Street Journal.

660
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,613
But there's a quiz there that determines
if you're a summer or a fall.

661
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:23,865
I appreciate this. Thank you.

662
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,082
Morey, you remember the time
that Rory decided...

663
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,252
that our old tree stump was a fairy ring?

664
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:39,047
- I sure do.
- How old was she then, sugar?

665
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,381
I think she was about 10.

666
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,759
All I know is
that it matched the description.

667
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,636
Oh, God, she was cute.

668
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:47,472
She used to sit out there
with a peanut-butter sandwich...

669
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,974
just waiting for the fairy to get hungry.

670
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:51,809
Okay. New story.

671
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:56,356
I'm still crushed beyond belief
that she quit her ballet lessons.

672
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:57,940
Oh, not me.

673
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:02,278
Miss Perfect Work Ethic would
prance around this room 24 hours a day.

674
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,489
- And I still stunk.
- I can vouch for that.

675
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:07,575
- That's not true.
- She was pretty bad.

676
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:11,704
Don't you listen to them.
You had a true gift.

677
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:14,832
What?

678
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,920
She did. She was talented.

679
00:38:27,678 --> 00:38:29,097
I made that.

680
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,683
- Really?
- From Rory's old baby clothes.

681
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,270
How nice. I hope you washed them first.

682
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,898
Oh, rats. I knew I forgot something.

683
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:44,487
That's quite an assortment of characters
you have down there.

684
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:46,030
They're great people.

685
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,116
- This Patricia.
- Miss Patty.

686
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:50,701
- She teaches dance?
- Among other things.

687
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,413
- This man with the ice...
- Luke.

688
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:56,374
How long have you been seeing him?

689
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:59,377
I'm not seeing Luke. He's just a friend.

690
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:04,632
Mom, I swear.
Luke keeps me in coffee. Nothing else.

691
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,384
He seems to like you.

692
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:09,554
- And you're judging this by what?
- By the way he looked at you.

693
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:10,847
Which was how?

694
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:13,224
Like you were about to
give him a lap dance.

695
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:17,061
- Mom, he did not look at me like that.
- You're pleased.

696
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,896
- What?
- You smiled.

697
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,191
You're glad that the ice man
looked at you like a porterhouse steak.

698
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:24,235
I'm smiling because you're crazy...

699
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:27,572
and that's what you do to crazy people
to keep them calm.

700
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:37,915
- What's this?
- That's me, Mom.

701
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,877
I know it's you. You're wearing a cast.

702
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,296
Yeah. That's when I broke my leg.

703
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,800
- You broke your leg?
- Yeah, three years ago during a yoga class.

704
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:50,761
The headstand portion
took a very ugly turn.

705
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,266
The good thing was that I brought the
smug, blonde, pretzel chick down with me.

706
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:58,436
I've since learned
that I'm a bit too competitive for yoga.

707
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,231
- I never knew you broke your leg.
- It was no big deal, Mom.

708
00:40:02,648 --> 00:40:05,526
If I had been really sick
you would have known.

709
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:15,328
You could get a maid in here
once a week to at least tidy up.

710
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,663
- I like it cluttered.
- You can't even find the bed.

711
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:21,584
Yes, I can. It's the thing I crash into
on the way to the closet.

712
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:25,087
I should go check on your father.

713
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,507
It was nice that you came tonight, Mom.

714
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:33,012
It meant a lot to Rory. Really.

715
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:35,806
She is my granddaughter, after all.

716
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:38,517
- I should be here.
- I totally agree.

717
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:43,648
Leave it, Mom.

718
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:56,994
- It's time to go now.
- In a minute, please.

719
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,500
- Rory, we're going to get going now.
- Thank you for coming.

720
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,460
Thank you for asking me.

721
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:07,463
Lovely party.

722
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:10,675
I enjoyed the reading material immensely.

723
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:14,720
- So what's the verdict?
- I am an autumn.

724
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,056
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

725
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:21,435
So are you guys leaving?
The mud wrestling starts in 10 minutes.

726
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,271
Good night, Lorelai. We had a lovely time.

727
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:27,650
And with a straight face you said that.

728
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:31,112
I'd have that chimney inspected
if I were you.

729
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:33,030
I'll get right on that, Dad.

730
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:36,617
- For Fez.
- But you already took care of Fez.

731
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,828
Fez is a very large city.

732
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:52,258
- Food fight?
- Absolutely.

733
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:08,232
She's right.
I don't know my daughter at all.

734
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:15,990
We should go. Traffic.

735
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:24,790
Next year we are going to a McDonald's
with one of those slides, and that's it.

736
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,458
The party was a hit.

737
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:29,044
And we'll be eating onion dip
for breakfast for a week.

738
00:42:29,086 --> 00:42:32,882
You mix that dip with ground turkey
and garlic, and it is really not bad.

739
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:35,551
- I'm not looking for a recipe.
- Reflex. Sorry.

740
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:38,387
- I'm gonna go check the living room.
- Okay.

741
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,894
You didn't have to get me anything.

742
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:47,563
Sorry. That's the rules.
You get older, you get a gift.

743
00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:50,316
I'm sorry about this sort of sneaky thing.

744
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:53,319
I just haven't told my mother yet
about you.

745
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:57,907
- Not that there's anything to tell.
- It's okay. This is better.

746
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:08,250
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

747
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:12,588
I bought the medallion,
and then I just cut some leather straps...

748
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:15,633
and drilled a hole and, well...

749
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:18,802
Do you like it?

750
00:43:20,846 --> 00:43:22,640
- It's amazing.
- Good.

751
00:43:23,974 --> 00:43:25,976
- Thank you.
- Here.
