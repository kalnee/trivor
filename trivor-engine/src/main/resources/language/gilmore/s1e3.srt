1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,670
Previously on Gilmore Girls. 

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,923
Independence Inn. Michel speaking.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,216
I fixed the peach sauce.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,760
- I wanna take a bath in that sauce.
- I will make more.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,179
Let Michel look at your French paper
before you go.

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,264
- Excuse me.
- That'd be great.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,641
- What's going on?
- Open it.

8
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,186
- I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
- You're going to Chilton! Sorry.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,729
I told Mom you're changing schools.

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,648
- Was she thrilled?
- The party's on Friday.

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,983
I got the invoice for your enrollment fee.

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,860
You did it, babe. You got in.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,321
Wow, that is a lot of zeros
behind that five.

14
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,824
- Hi, Mom.
- Lorelai. My goodness, this is a surprise.

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:37,162
- So, you need money.
- It's not for me. It's for Rory.

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,249
Since we are now
financially involved in your life...

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,376
I want to be actively involved in your life.

18
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,836
Ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,838
Mom, what are you doing here?

20
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:50,050
I came to wish my granddaughter luck
on her first day of school.

21
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,137
She is my daughter.
And I decide how we live, not you.

22
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,015
I'm allowed to pay for it
but not set foot on the premises.

23
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,184
- I just wanna get the rules straight.
- Oh, boy.

24
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,941
- So this whole plaid skirt thing, my idea?
- My day sucked, too.

25
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,697
- Dinner was lovely, Emily.
- Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.

26
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,032
- Who's Mira?
- Our cook.

27
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,161
- I thought the cook was Heidi.
- No, we let Heidi go months ago.

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,790
She had a problem closing things.
The door, the refrigerator...

29
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,542
The liquor bottle.

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,254
- Then it was Trina, then Sophia.
- I liked Sophia.

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,506
- You did not.
- I didn't?

32
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,176
- She was the one who sang.
- That's right. Terrible woman.

33
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,513
And after Sophia, we had Anton.

34
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,516
That's right.
Anton was the one that I liked.

35
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm sorry. Dad, how do you mix up
Anton and Sophia?

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,274
- What do you mean?
- One is a man and one is a woman.

37
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,153
- And your point being...
- That one is a man and one is a woman.

38
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,655
I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai.

39
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,115
I don't have time to keep up...

40
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,452
with the multitudes of people
that your mother employs.

41
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,164
But one is a man and one is a woman.

42
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,004
- The dinner was so wonderful, Mira.
- It's Sarah.

43
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,047
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,885
Mom, her name is Sarah.

45
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,554
I thought she said Mira.

46
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,142
Grandma, these plates are really pretty.

47
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,353
Thank you, Rory.
They were your great-grandmother's.

48
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,523
- Lorelai I.
- I thought mom was the first.

49
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,025
Not in the name.

50
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,862
No, but in so many other things,
I was a regular trailblazer.

51
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,572
Just finishing your thought, Mom.

52
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
Lorelai I was my mother.

53
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,826
She was
an extremely accomplished equestrian...

54
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,703
a distinguished patron of the arts...

55
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,998
and she was also world-famous
for her masquerade balls.

56
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,750
She was quite a woman, my mother.

57
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,252
Yes, she was.
Mira, come cut the cake, please.

58
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,672
Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah
out here with you?

59
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,610
So, Lorelai, how are things
at that charming little inn of yours?

60
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
They're still charming and little.

61
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,741
We're crossing our fingers it doesn't
assert itself and become rude and large.

62
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,952
Mom's having a huge wedding there
this week.

63
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,287
- Really?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,747
There's people coming
from all over the country.

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,541
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,377
- Rory, how's Chilton?
- Okay, done with me now.

67
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,462
I'm sorry, was there more to the story?

68
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,299
- Rory has to pick a team sport to play.
- It's a requirement.

69
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,636
"Physical fitness is as important
as intellectual fitness."

70
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,682
- So says Plato, and so say I.
- What sport are you going to pick?

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,768
I'm not sure.
I'm not really the athletic type.

72
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,271
I told her she should go out
for the debating team.

73
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,774
- That's not a sport.
- It is, the way the Gilmores play.

74
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,611
- So, what are your choices?
- God, there are a thousand of them.

75
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,657
Basketball, lacrosse,
swimming, track, golf.

76
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,325
- Golf?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,828
Your grandfather is a golf player.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,915
He plays every week at the club.
He could teach you to play like a pro.

79
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,585
He could take you there on Sunday.
It's perfect.

80
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,879
It's not something you can teach
in an afternoon.

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,381
That's okay. Rory can pick something else.

82
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,883
Why should she?

83
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,303
She needs to learn a sport,
and Richard can teach her a sport.

84
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,263
You can use your mother's old golf clubs.

85
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,099
They're gathering dust
along with the rest of her potential.

86
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,810
Okay. Mom, could I maybe
talk to you for a minute?

87
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,022
- We're having dessert.
- I know, but I'd like to talk to you fast...

88
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,065
before the sugar sets in
and makes me crazy.

89
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,027
- You are the oddest person.
- Too easy.

90
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,113
What is so important
that can't wait for cake?

91
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,573
Keep moving.

92
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,870
This is as far as I can go,
unless I bore my way through the wall.

93
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,622
- Don't do this, Mom.
- Do what?

94
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,042
- Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.
- I'm not forcing anybody.

95
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,086
You're manipulating the situation,
giving no one a way out.

96
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,671
That's force. Look it up.

97
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,924
I'm trying to help your daughter
get an education.

98
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,259
- Thanks, she'll find another sport.
- Why should she?

99
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,762
She doesn't wanna go,
and Dad doesn't wanna take her.

100
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,641
He doesn't know what he wants. He'd cut
his hair at the butcher's, if I let him.

101
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,643
Just let it go, please.

102
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,978
Well, isn't this interesting?

103
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,106
- You're afraid.
- Of what?

104
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,902
That Rory will enjoy the club
and have a good time without you.

105
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,987
- That's crazy.
- I agree.

106
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,365
- I'm not afraid.
- Then let her go.

107
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,285
- She won't enjoy it, Mom.
- Why don't we just let Rory decide?

108
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,746
Because she's the sweetest kid
in the whole world.

109
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,999
She won't say she doesn't wanna go
to avoid hurting your feelings.

110
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,253
I'm sure you could give her some coaching
to get her over that.

111
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:22,090
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
Believe it or not, this is not about you.

112
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,758
Of course it's about me.

113
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,428
If Rory goes and has a good time
without you, then I win.

114
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,766
Okay, Bob Barker. Rory knocks herself out
all week at Chilton.

115
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,103
The weekends are the only time she has
to unwind and have fun.

116
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,980
- With you.
- I'm there.

117
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,274
So let me get this straight.

118
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,776
There's no way
that Rory could possibly enjoy...

119
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,361
a weekend day with her grandfather.

120
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,405
You're just gonna twist it all around.

121
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,075
You know your daughter so well that you
don't even have to ask her opinion.

122
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,160
She'd be miserable, and you'd know it.

123
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,664
I'm so setting myself up here.
But, yes, she would be miserable.

124
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,418
- That sounds a little controlling to me.
- I walked right into that.

125
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,504
Interesting, isn't it,
you being the one who's controlling?

126
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,298
- I am not being...
- According to you...

127
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,508
I was the only one in the family
with that gift.

128
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,801
I never said that!

129
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,471
I guess you and I are more alike
than you thought, aren't we?

130
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,516
You win.

131
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,227
Thank you.

132
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,321
- Did you get blind-sided? I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

133
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,656
- I tried to stop it, I swear.
- I know.

134
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,700
- Maybe it won't be that bad.
- Maybe it won't.

135
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,618
- Maybe I'll like it.
- Maybe you will.

136
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,496
- Maybe you could come with me.
- Is there a You're Crazy team?

137
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,373
- 'Cause they'd make you captain.
- Please.

138
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,126
I love you. I would take a bullet for you.

139
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,254
But I'd rather stick a sharp thing in my ear
than go to the club.

140
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,297
Fine.

141
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,716
I'd rather slide down
a banister of razorblades...

142
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,510
and land in a pool of alcohol
than go to the club with you.

143
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,387
- I got it.
- Don't stop me, I'm on a roll.

144
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,474
I'd rather eat my own hand
than go to the club with you.

145
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,978
I'd rather surgically alter my face to look
like the mad rich lady with the lion head...

146
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,229
than go to the club with you.

147
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,149
Would you like me to drive
so you can continue your diatribe?

148
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,903
Would you? Thanks. I'd rather cut off
my head and use it as a punch bowl...

149
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
than go to the club with you.

150
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,122
You'll walk down here, over the bridge...

151
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,666
with the swans floating by
and the music playing.

152
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,794
What are they doing
with those purple flowers?

153
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,087
Just decorating the bridge.

154
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,631
I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.

155
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,049
And I wanted blue.

156
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,301
So I thought violet
would be a nice compromise.

157
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,346
- But we paid for pink flowers.
- And the blue flowers.

158
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,058
You did not pay for anything.
I told her to decorate with violet flowers.

159
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,561
It's nice of her to try to take
the heat for me, but it's unnecessary.

160
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,940
If you don't like it, buy your own flowers.

161
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,570
Yes. I thought so.

162
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,199
Now, go away. My Advil is wearing off.

163
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,582
- Their father spoiled them.
- They're just excited.

164
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,251
They're spoiled.

165
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,170
And they won't move away.

166
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,343
- Now, disaster list. What if it rains?
- We'll put up tents.

167
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,720
- What if it's too windy?
- We'll secure everything...

168
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,681
and put extra hairspray
in everybody's hair.

169
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,723
Too hot?

170
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,101
Umbrellas and fans
that won't cause any damage...

171
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,688
because of the things that have been
secured and hair that's been sprayed.

172
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,898
- So I have nothing to worry about?
- No.

173
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,485
- There must be something.
- Listen, I have everything under control.

174
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,696
Go to your room
and have a fabulous bubble bath.

175
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,155
I'll send up some wine...

176
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,493
and a masseuse who bears a remarkable
resemblance to Antonio Banderas.

177
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,788
- How remarkable?
- Get ready to applaud.

178
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,417
This is my favorite place
in the whole world.

179
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,768
Could you send Maury up to Room 12
in about 20 minutes? Thanks.

180
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,980
- So, any problems?
- With the wedding or my life?

181
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,816
One guess. And I'll give you a hint:
It's not your life.

182
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,694
- Do you stage these events to torture me?
- Yes.

183
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,323
- Job well done.
- Okay, let's start again. Any problems?

184
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,160
Guests are checked in,
baskets are given out...

185
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:23,414
and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds
have been delivered.

186
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,791
- Okay, good. Did Rory call?
- No.

187
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,962
She's golfing all day with my father,
and I'm half-expecting...

188
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,008
this big, "Save me!" call to come in.
You don't care at all, do you?

189
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,470
To me you are the teacher
in the Charlie Brown cartoon.

190
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,805
Forget it. Have the grooms arrived?

191
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,141
Their plane was due at 7:30.
They should be here.

192
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,270
- Maybe they made a run for it.
- Somebody got stood up at prom.

193
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,901
- Oh, dear.
- What?

194
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,743
- Are those...
- No, it would be too...

195
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,203
Schmoopies!

196
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,456
...weird.

197
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,750
You kept this from me on purpose.

198
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,711
It's like a really snooty
Doublemint commercial.

199
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,090
Just let me know
when the midgets and clowns arrive.

200
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,800
No.

201
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,637
You have to get them all settled in.

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,514
- I'm not talking to them.
- Yes, you are.

203
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,891
I'm not talking to them nicely.

204
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,394
It's after 8:00. She should be here already.

205
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,562
She'll be here.

206
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,065
You're supposed to tee off
at your designated time.

207
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,610
You pay good money to that place.
You'll tee off when you tee off.

208
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,154
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.

209
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,617
- What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
- Nothing. It's fine.

210
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,620
- This whole thing is absurd.
- She's your granddaughter.

211
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,331
She's a 16-year-old
who would rather be at the mall.

212
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:50,167
Show her all around the club,
especially the rose garden.

213
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,670
- I am not a guide.
- Make sure you take her to lunch...

214
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,090
- and have her get dessert.
- No one said anything about lunch.

215
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,259
I hope Lorelai's clubs
are still in good shape.

216
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,302
Emily, you are not listening to me.

217
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,430
I will teach her to golf,
as promised by you...

218
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,307
but lunch is out of the question.

219
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,311
You have to eat, so you'll eat together.
Do you have sunscreen?

220
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,314
- She's here.
- 8:30.

221
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,942
We must remember to buy her a watch.

222
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,070
Richard, so help me God,
you will be sweet to this girl...

223
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,030
and make this a memorable day for her.

224
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,284
It's the first time we can
show our granddaughter off at the club.

225
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,204
And it means a great deal
to my happiness and yours...

226
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,164
that this day go well.

227
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,916
Are we clear?

228
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,672
- Rory, hello!
- Sorry I'm late.

229
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,716
Nonsense, you're right on time.

230
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,259
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Nice to see you.

231
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,013
- This is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it?
- It's cooler at 8:00.

232
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,264
Am I dressed okay?

233
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,641
I didn't have
any of those short pant things.

234
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,979
Actually, there is something missing.
Wait a minute.

235
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,860
Here we go.

236
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,280
- Now you look just like Tiger Woods.
- That's some hat.

237
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,365
Okay, off you go, you two.

238
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,868
- Have a wonderful time.
- We will.

239
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,411
You bet.

240
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,721
Is it hard to become a member here?

241
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,266
Everyone has to go through
a thorough screening process.

242
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,478
- Kind of like the FBI?
- We're much more thorough than that.

243
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,854
- Wow.
- Yes.

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,609
Do you know
the merger of Forscape and DSS...

245
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,278
- happened right here on this lawn?
- Really?

246
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,822
International finance
will never be the same...

247
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,367
and all because of a lost golfing bet.

248
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,036
- That's crazy.
- That's high finance.

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,581
Here we are.

250
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,545
What do you know about golf?

251
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,216
That it's a good walk spoiled.

252
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,973
Your driver is the most powerful club
in your bag...

253
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,520
and as such,
it can be your most valuable asset...

254
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,730
or your greatest liability.

255
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,442
To wield it properly
requires a precise combination...

256
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,945
of confidence and humility.

257
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,448
- Confidence and humility. Got it.
- There you are.

258
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,034
That's a pretty good natural grip.

259
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,412
Now line the toe of your left foot
up with the ball.

260
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,749
That's right. Drop this shoulder a little bit.

261
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,294
Now, keeping your left arm firm,
draw the club back...

262
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,297
and swing it cleanly through the ball.

263
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,594
I'm betting that was wrong.

264
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,764
There are no rights and wrongs
to the learning process.

265
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,397
Try that again.

266
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,865
I'm betting that was wrong.

267
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,954
These are blueberries.
I ordered strawberries.

268
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,957
- I know...
- I did. I wrote it down, I got a copy.

269
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,501
- Sookie, listen.
- Yeah. "Mushrooms, melon..."

270
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,338
- "endive, peaches, kiwi."
- Excuse me, crazy lady.

271
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,299
I should make some kiwi ice cream.

272
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,758
- Sookie! Listen.
- What?

273
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,887
I know you ordered strawberries,
but they weren't any good.

274
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,180
Instead of selling you
substandard strawberries...

275
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,266
I brought you blueberries.

276
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,643
I must make strawberry shortcake
for 200 people...

277
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,437
so I think I'll need strawberries.

278
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,480
- Use the blueberries.
- To make what?

279
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,275
- Blueberry shortcake.
- There's no such thing.

280
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,652
The world was flat
until someone took a boat trip.

281
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,196
- Can I see these strawberries?
- No.

282
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,656
- Just one?
- No.

283
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,491
How about a Polaroid?

284
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,911
Coffee.

285
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,331
Sookie, can I take
some of this cake home to Rory?

286
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,083
She's gonna need a special treat tonight.

287
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,545
She's spending the entire day
with my father, golfing at the club.

288
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,630
No.

289
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,757
- Take the blueberries!
- No!

290
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,635
The whole thing was masterminded
by my mother.

291
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,262
One minute we're having
an excruciating family dinner...

292
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,515
and the next minute she's manipulated
my kid to spend her Sunday...

293
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,559
with my father at the country club.

294
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,520
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's making me too upset.

295
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,900
- Tell me something happy.
- I can't make the strawberry shortcake.

296
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,736
You suck at this game.

297
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,365
The battle for soup versus salad
is raging in the other room.

298
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,991
Come quick and settle it, please.

299
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,995
I'm running out of French curse words
that they won't understand.

300
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,045
- Soup it's gonna be.
- You always have a salad...

301
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,714
- before a traditional meal.
- Why are you making a scene?

302
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,466
- It's my party.
- Just 'cause...

303
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,302
It's been 45 minutes of "soup or salad."

304
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,137
I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab.

305
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,723
I'm going to go far away now,
and never come back.

306
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,268
How about if the guests
get a choice of soup or salad?

307
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,647
That will work.

308
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,068
- Choice of soup or salad.
- Got it.

309
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,947
- It's so weird.
- Which one is which?

310
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,782
I think the one on the right is Matt.

311
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:17,119
No, that's the one on the left.
The one on the right is Mark.

312
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,372
- That's very impressive.
- I'm very good at observing people...

313
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:24,751
learning their tics and traits,
the sound of their voices. It's a gift.

314
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,712
- That one has a Post-it on its back.
- Then that's Mark.

315
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,297
The one on the right is Matt.

316
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,216
- Take that off of him.
- I will not.

317
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,969
We can't all call everyone "sweetie"
and get away with it.

318
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,764
Go with me here, but let's say
Mark walks into a hotel room...

319
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,183
and he sees his wife naked,
but it's not his wife...

320
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,228
it's his naked sister-in-law,
and he has sex with her.

321
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,522
- Would that be cheating?
- My head hurts.

322
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,441
- I think no.
- Really? Lucky.

323
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,486
If you ask me, this union
belongs on a public access station.

324
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,323
It's against the laws of nature,
and just this short of completely obscene.

325
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,118
You won't be giving the wedding toast.

326
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,414
- How did everything work out?
- Do you have children?

327
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:04,958
- A daughter.
- Do you hate her?

328
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,751
- No.
- Not ever?

329
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,630
I wasn't wildly fond of her during labor.

330
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,341
That was the high point for me.

331
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,348
- I can't believe I hit the ball.
- It's quite impressive.

332
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,436
- It landed in the water.
- Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.

333
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,605
This place is so beautiful.

334
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,191
I could see just coming here
to think or read...

335
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,277
but that defeats the purpose
of the holes with the flags in them.

336
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,780
There is something rather serene
about walking around here.

337
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,658
- Do you come here every week?
- No. When I can.

338
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,994
I'm often working on the weekends.

339
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,829
- Bummer.
- Isn't it?

340
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,918
Hi, Richard.

341
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,963
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

342
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,008
- What do you do?
- I'm the Executive Vice President...

343
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,260
of the Gehrman-Driscoll
Insurance Corporation.

344
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,887
- Wow.
- Yes.

345
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,099
And as Executive Vice President,
what do you do?

346
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,520
It's a very big company,
one of the largest in the United States.

347
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,272
I have a myriad of duties...

348
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,192
which would bore you greatly
to hear about.

349
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,069
Okay.

350
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,034
- I oversee our international division.
- That sounds important.

351
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:23,078
It rates a parking spot.

352
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,289
- Do you get to travel a lot?
- Quite a bit.

353
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,666
Lucky.

354
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,920
- I suspect you have a yen for travel.
- I'm up to my ears in yens.

355
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:35,298
- Any particular place you'd like to go?
- Hundreds of places:

356
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,760
Paris, Rome, London,
Prague, Istanbul, Fez.

357
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,721
- Have you ever been to Fez?
- I can't say that I have.

358
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,556
I wanna go to Fez.

359
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:47,310
I think traveling, for a young girl,
is a very important thing.

360
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,562
Your mother never got a chance
to travel much.

361
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,108
- I know. She talks about that all the time.
- She does?

362
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,902
We've got a deal.
When I graduate from high school...

363
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,863
we're gonna go backpacking
through Europe together.

364
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,199
You know, do the whole hostel thing.

365
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:05,787
- I just hope it really happens.
- We'll just have to make sure that it does.

366
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,254
- You look wonderful.
- Aren't you sweet? Is Emily here?

367
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:17,340
No, I'm taking my granddaughter
for a round of golf.

368
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,260
- We must get together.
- Absolutely.

369
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,768
The most odious woman alive.

370
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,158
- We'll meet back here in 40 minutes?
- Okay.

371
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,161
And then, if you like,
we can get some lunch.

372
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,455
- That would be great.
- Fine.

373
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,665
- Cool.
- Yes.

374
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,259
And I'm telling him,
"I've been coming here..."

375
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:04,804
"for 20 years, my young friend,
and for 20 years, that cart..."

376
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,724
"Number 43, has been my golf cart."

377
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:10,768
- He should have known that.
- Everybody knows it.

378
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,813
- Did he give you the cart?
- Damn right he gave me the cart.

379
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,109
You should have never had to ask,
because he should have known that.

380
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,528
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Richard, good to see you.

381
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,365
- I heard about your golf cart. Too bad.
- I'm still angry about it.

382
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,369
Who was that young lady
I saw you on the golf course with?

383
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,873
- That is my granddaughter.
- Really? She's lovely.

384
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,625
Lorelai's girl.

385
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:38,338
You're lucky. My granddaughter looks like
she just fell off a potato truck.

386
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,966
My granddaughter
would never be caught here.

387
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,011
It might get in the way
of her time spent at the tattoo parlor...

388
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:48,014
or getting something pierced,
or doing whatever she does...

389
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,643
while she runs wild through the streets
like a rabid dog.

390
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:55,605
- Cut her off. That'll get her attention.
- I can help you with the litigation.

391
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,982
Actually, Rory just started Chilton.

392
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,984
- Really?
- Damn fine school.

393
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:04,030
She said she wanted to learn golf.
I think she's taken to it quite well.

394
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,617
Yeah, just as long as she's not taken
with a certain golf cart.

395
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,954
- I'm writing a letter to the board.
- I wish you would.

396
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,039
Listen to me.

397
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,959
She took the house and I'm against it.

398
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,753
She deserved it,
putting up with that tramp all those years.

399
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:22,048
Last Christmas,
he bought them both the same bracelet.

400
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,509
She should have shot him
like his first wife did.

401
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,803
I love Janie. Is she out yet?

402
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,057
Gloria, hi. Good game?

403
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,935
- Not bad. You?
- I just came for the steam.

404
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,521
We must get together and play
sometime soon.

405
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:38,606
- Next week?
- I'll call you.

406
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,070
The most odious woman alive.

407
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:58,418
Okay, I need more tulle here.
I need the feeling of a major tutu, okay?

408
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:06,467
Gary, the ribbons go on the chairs,
not on the trees.

409
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:10,221
Oh, great.

410
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,477
Where do you want the swans?

411
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,230
- Do you know where the pond is?
- Nope.

412
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:22,316
- You know that little road you came up?
- Nope.

413
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,903
Do you know how to say "big help"
in Chinese?

414
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,447
- Nope.
- Michel!

415
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,949
This is 20 swans?

416
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,869
Sure. Why not?

417
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:35,496
You screeched?

418
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,665
I need you to show him
where to put the swans.

419
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,958
Absolutely not.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,628
I can't leave. I've got a major tulle festival
going on out here.

421
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,298
- I will never go near those filthy birds.
- Why?

422
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,009
- I hate the swans.
- These particular swans?

423
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:49,594
No, all swans.

424
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,805
I was attacked by a band of swans
in the Luxembourg Gardens...

425
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,849
when I was a boy. No one forgets that.

426
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,352
Oh, no, not being attacked
by a band of swans.

427
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:02,982
Was it an all-boy band?
Kind of a scary, feathery, 'NSync fiasco?

428
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:06,110
- This is not funny.
- No, I'm sorry. It's not funny at all.

429
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:07,862
Oh, my God.

430
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:11,324
Come on,
you have to admit that's a little funny.

431
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,910
Hey, Pepe Le Pew,
you want to give me a hand with this?

432
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:14,994
No.

433
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,830
Listen, it's Drella or the swans.

434
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,166
So either one beast of terror or another?

435
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,001
- What is he babbling about?
- Don't...

436
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,836
- He's afraid of the swans.
- Thank you.

437
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,796
Of course he is. He's French.

438
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,716
- Okay, I'll take you to the pond.
- Thank you.

439
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,179
But stay far away from me.

440
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,189
Can't stand the talk.
Love to watch the walk.

441
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,902
She caught him in the pool house
with the tennis pro...

442
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:49,779
not the riding instructor.

443
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,113
I had no idea.

444
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:54,742
That committee of yours is not
looking at people as much as you think.

445
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,786
Why would they?
From what you've told me...

446
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,914
they're all involved
in one nefarious activity after another.

447
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,541
- It's a conspiracy.
- It's Peyton Place.

448
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,169
- Is there more?
- Can you handle it?

449
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,879
I'll steel myself.

450
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:10,383
Okay, Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.

451
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:13,010
Good God, he's my broker.

452
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,472
I don't think one will affect the other.

453
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,475
- Mind if we barge in?
- Look who's here.

454
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:23,771
Rory, this is Julian Johnson
and Edward James.

455
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,357
- Call me Ed.
- You can call me Ed, too.

456
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,528
- It's nice to meet you.
- Would you care to join us?

457
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:34,407
If Rory doesn't mind us intruding
on her time with her grandfather.

458
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:36,701
- No, that's fine.
- Great.

459
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,830
- So, we hear you're attending Chilton.
- I just started.

460
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:42,748
- That's a hard school.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,251
- Rory is an excellent student.
- Really?

462
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,253
4.0 grade point average.

463
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,714
That's got me beat.

464
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:54,552
She's going to Fez someday.

465
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,887
Fez? What the hell is in Fez?

466
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,557
That's for her to find out.

467
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:12,945
Interesting hat.

468
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:16,115
I went golfing with my grandfather today.

469
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:18,743
Did you know golf courses
are an environmental blight...

470
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,245
because of the chemicals
used to keep the grass green?

471
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:22,872
Actually, I did.

472
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,041
Bad joke. Sorry.

473
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:36,927
My God. This day,
the swans, the tulle, my head.

474
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:39,722
I need the largest cheeseburger
in the world.

475
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,307
Let's break a record, mister.

476
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,770
So, the wedding is a nightmare.
We got these 10 boxes of creepy larvae...

477
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:49,106
that are supposed to swarm
into butterflies on the wedding day.

478
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,776
They swarmed a little early.
What's with the hat?

479
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:53,152
Grandma gave it to me.

480
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,738
- That's just mean.
- It's not that bad.

481
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,282
- Do you want a mirror?
- I'm taking it off.

482
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:02,369
- So, Rory's golfing adventure. Tell me.
- It was fine.

483
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:06,165
I brought you some of Sookie's
chocolate cake to make you feel better.

484
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,666
It really wasn't that bad.

485
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,585
You're the sweetest kid
in the whole world.

486
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,337
Where on earth did you get that from?

487
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,965
Luke, am I mistaken,
or did the sign on the door say "open"?

488
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,051
- So where were we?
- Me golfing.

489
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:18,719
- Right. Go.
- Okay.

490
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,598
By the end of the day
I could even hit the ball.

491
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:25,309
Sometimes it wasn't my ball,
but the intentions were good.

492
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:28,187
Good intentions
and no physical exertion whatsoever...

493
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,231
is what the game of golf was built on.

494
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:31,440
So did you order?

495
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,109
I'm not hungry.
I had a big lunch at the club.

496
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:36,362
With all the other devastators of our land.

497
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,989
Luke, I'm really sorry. I didn't know.

498
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:43,869
- You had a big lunch at the club?
- Yeah, it was quite good.

499
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,997
- Quite? What's with the "quite"?
- What do you mean?

500
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,582
You don't ever say "quite."

501
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,960
- I've said "quite" plenty of times.
- Whatever.

502
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:54,463
Besides the "quite good" lunch you had,
what else happened?

503
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:58,217
Nothing. We played. I met his friends.
I took a steam.

504
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,261
- You took a steam?
- Yeah.

505
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:03,430
I sweated out all my toxins,
and I stole a towel.

506
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:07,184
- Sounds like you really had a good time.
- I did.

507
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,727
Really?

508
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:13,023
- Okay, new word now.
- Sorry. I'm just surprised.

509
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,528
- I thought you were gonna be bored.
- I was kind of surprised, too.

510
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,698
I don't know, it was pretty there.
And Grandpa and I talked a lot.

511
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,325
- You talked? Really?
- You're doing it again.

512
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:24,952
Sorry. You talked?

513
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:28,831
- We talked about Fez.
- And he thought it was a hat.

514
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:32,876
I told him about our backpacking trip,
and he thought it was a great idea.

515
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,214
So you really had fun?

516
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,843
That's great.

517
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,263
That is really, really great.

518
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:49,893
- I thought you were starving.
- Things change. Move on.

519
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,231
Does this hat really look bad on me?

520
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,781
No, I think it looks kind of cute.

521
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:12,166
It's your wedding day. Feel each other.

522
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:15,085
Use the thumping of your heart
as a metronome.

523
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:18,172
Let passion be your choreographer.

524
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,009
Be as light on your toes
as you are in your hearts.

525
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,137
Oh, no, darling.
Let me show you how it's done.

526
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,388
Again?

527
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:31,185
You know, in some countries,
if you dance this close...

528
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,479
you're cheating on your wife.

529
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,939
- You're next.
- Take your time.

530
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,291
- My God, you've good handwriting.
- Thank you.

531
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:57,711
You did not get that from me.
Your fabulous flair you got from me.

532
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:01,131
- I also got my deviated septum from you.
- Hey, focus on the flair.

533
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,258
It's for you. He says he's your father...

534
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,803
although why he'd volunteer that freely,
I don't know.

535
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,012
- My father?
- Yes.

536
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:10,349
- Are you sure?
- Please just take the phone. Thank you.

537
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:11,975
Dad?

538
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,687
Yeah, it's Lorelai.
Who else calls you "dad"?

539
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:20,442
Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.
It's for you.

540
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,654
Thanks. Hello?

541
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:27,199
Hey, Grandpa. That's great.

542
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:31,745
Jackie wants Samuel Barber,
John Cage, and Philip Glass...

543
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:34,706
and Jessica wants
Shania Twain's I Feel Like a Woman.

544
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,542
- I'm not a jukebox.
- Oh, please.

545
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,335
You think I started playing the harp...

546
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:42,130
'cause I thought it would make me cool?
Finally get me in with the in-crowd?

547
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:45,050
Maybe I'd make for some
great happy-hour conversation.

548
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:47,803
No, all right? The music drives me, lady.

549
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:50,514
I will play what I feel, and you will love it.

550
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:54,476
- I'll give you an extra $100.
- You just got yourself a jukebox.

551
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,191
Yeah, I'd love to see it.

552
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:04,570
No, if you want to.

553
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,115
Sure. That sounds good. Yeah.

554
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,795
Should I leave you two alone?

555
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:25,340
- I think I want to change my hair.
- Really?

556
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,968
- I think it looks quite good.
- You're funny.

557
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,471
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yeah, water.

558
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:40,063
- So, you talked to Grandpa today?
- What?

559
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,858
- Grandpa, he called?
- Yeah.

560
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,027
Anything wrong?

561
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,946
No, he just found this book
we were talking about.

562
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:53,118
- And he just called to tell you?
- Yeah. Why?

563
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:57,372
Nothing. It's just weird.
He doesn't call the inn that much.

564
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,124
Or ever, actually.

565
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,586
- He knew that I was looking for it, so...
- Oh, sure.

566
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,464
- What book is it?
- Mencken's Chrestomathy.

567
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,799
- Oh, that one.
- Yeah.

568
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:13,221
Cinnamon is stuck
under our front porch again.

569
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:16,016
Can I borrow some vegetable oil
and a shoehorn?

570
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,935
- I'll get it.
- I'm calling him and calling him...

571
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,145
and I go around the porch...

572
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:23,273
and this big orange tush
is just staring me in the face.

573
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:24,399
I hate when that happens.

574
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,319
Yeah. He must have been meowing
for an hour...

575
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,989
but Morey was playing some Thelonious
on the Steinway...

576
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:33,700
and when Morey plays,
I go into this trance...

577
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:37,788
where all I can see is blue,
and moon, and stars.

578
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:43,293
Never mind, sugar. Play me home, baby!

579
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,258
Bye.

580
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:54,930
Oh, God! It's killing me!

581
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,771
- Babbette didn't take her oil.
- Keep it.

582
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:05,023
Christmas is early this year.

583
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:06,691
You know what I was thinking?

584
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,902
That Madonna and Sean Penn
should get remarried?

585
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:09,986
Besides that.

586
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,865
I was thinking your golfing expedition
should totally count as a dinner.

587
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:16,243
- What do you mean?
- I can get us out of dinner...

588
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:19,538
at the grandparents' on Friday.
Maybe we could grab a movie.

589
00:33:20,914 --> 00:33:23,625
- That's okay.
- It's no big deal, really.

590
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,461
No. It's just gonna get Grandma
all freaked out.

591
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:29,464
I can handle those freak-outs.
I've done that.

592
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:34,386
I have to get the book
from Grandpa anyway. Let's just go.

593
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,890
- All right, if you really want to.
- I do.

594
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:42,060
Okay, fine.

595
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,022
- Is that my sweater?
- What?

596
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,400
- You're wearing my sweater.
- So?

597
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:51,736
No, it's okay. It's just...

598
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,574
I thought I asked you to at least ask
before you borrow my stuff.

599
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,492
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

600
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:02,664
It's not too much for a simple
"Can I borrow it, Mom?" is it?

601
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:05,041
No, it's not. Jeez, lighten up.

602
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:08,753
It's my favorite sweater, too.

603
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,547
- Since when?
- Since always.

604
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,799
- This is not your favorite sweater.
- Yes, it is.

605
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,844
Now it's gonna be stretched out,
like everything you borrow.

606
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:17,095
What are you talking about?

607
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:19,222
I'm talking about
that you take my sweaters...

608
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,016
wear them, and stretch them out.

609
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:24,936
I couldn't possibly stretch them out.
Your boobs are way bigger than mine.

610
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,730
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

611
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:30,150
- Your boobs are totally bigger than mine.
- You're crazy!

612
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,818
- Do you want to measure?
- What?

613
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:34,529
I'm serious. Why don't you go
get the measuring tape now?

614
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,281
I am not going to measure my boobs.

615
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:38,867
Because you know
that you are totally bigger.

616
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,368
- I'm going inside.
- Fine.

617
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:43,204
- Don't measure. We'll just compare bras.
- Stop it.

618
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:45,582
I'll stop it when you quit stealing my stuff!

619
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,000
You're cracked!

620
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,627
You're bigger!

621
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:03,016
"Your boobs are bigger than mine"?
I'm a mental case.

622
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,225
So apologize.

623
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:06,603
I was too mad and stupid
to apologize last night...

624
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,688
and she was gone
before I got up this morning.

625
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:11,941
- What is wrong with me?
- You're very possessive of your sweaters.

626
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:15,445
I understand. If somebody
breathes too hard on my paring knife...

627
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,572
I'm like a crazy spider monkey.

628
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:19,157
It's not about the sweater.

629
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,619
It's about the golfing thing
and the liking-it thing.

630
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:26,039
She had fun, Sookie,
just like my mother said she would.

631
00:35:26,122 --> 00:35:29,334
- Yeah, that's gotta hurt.
- She should have fun.

632
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,337
I want her to have a good relationship
with her grandparents.

633
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:35,507
Just because I don't
doesn't mean she shouldn't, right?

634
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,553
So then, why was I trying to
get her out of Friday night dinner?

635
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:42,639
Am I trying to
undermine their relationship?

636
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:43,890
- You weren't.
- I was.

637
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:45,809
- Yes, you were.
- Yes, I'm 4 years old.

638
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,685
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

639
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:50,772
You are. You're jealous
'cause they like Rory better than you.

640
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:52,524
Thank you for the hug.

641
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:54,150
See, I'm bad at advice talks.

642
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,611
Can we talk about soup?
'Cause I'm good with soup.

643
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:59,489
I'm sorry. You're fine. I'm all mixed-up.

644
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:02,700
I left that life: The club, my parents.

645
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:04,285
I ran from it as soon as I could.

646
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:08,081
It just never occurred to me
that she might want it.

647
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:11,501
It occurred to my mother though.
God, I hate that she was right.

648
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:13,795
You don't know that... Oh, my God.

649
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,338
Hey, watch it!

650
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:17,632
Stock.

651
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,093
Are you okay?

652
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:25,390
Look at you. You're beautiful!

653
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,893
I have to be more adult about this.

654
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,688
I mean, if the country club life
is what she wants...

655
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:33,481
more power to her, right?

656
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:36,234
You know, little white gloves
and coming-out parties.

657
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:39,237
- That makes some girls happy, right?
- Sure, yeah.

658
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,531
If they're on Prozac, absolutely.

659
00:36:41,614 --> 00:36:44,826
I just never thought
that I raised that kind of kid, you know?

660
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,245
Not that there's anything wrong
with kids like that.

661
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,998
I didn't think that was Rory.
Maybe it's not. I don't know.

662
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:52,750
Am I obsessing? Sookie? Hello?

663
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,129
Should I wear my strawberry costume
to get your attention?

664
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,714
No, I'm sorry.

665
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:59,757
You have a strawberry costume?

666
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:02,719
- Unbelievable!
- Jackson.

667
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:04,804
So this is what we've come to?

668
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:08,266
You sneaking around behind my back
buying somebody else's strawberries?

669
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:10,977
- I was desperate!
- You disgust me!

670
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,355
- I needed the strawberries.
- Well, now you have them.

671
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,357
I hope you're happy together.

672
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,401
- Jackson, wait!
- No!

673
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,820
- Come on, Jackson!
- No!

674
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,864
- Jackson, we can talk about it.
- No!

675
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:24,616
- Get back here!
- Get away from me!

676
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:26,534
Why are you following me?

677
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,578
- Don't you follow me.
- Come on!

678
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,136
Pardon me. There you are.

679
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,932
We did it. We sure did.

680
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:35,019
God, I feel wonderful!

681
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:37,355
I'm so glad it turned out
the way you wanted it to.

682
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,481
You have no idea.

683
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:42,944
They just told me they're going to share
a condo in Tucson, Arizona.

684
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:45,530
That's hundreds of miles away.

685
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,782
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

686
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,201
Sister Sledge! Excuse me.

687
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,009
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

688
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,470
- Good turnout?
- Yeah.

689
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,181
- Want something to drink?
- Are you trying to make up?

690
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:15,685
- No, I'm trying to hydrate you.
- I'm fine, thanks.

691
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,772
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

692
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:23,442
A crazy, evil spirit obsessed with bra size
took over my body.

693
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,236
- It happens.
- She's gone now.

694
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:26,779
Good to know.

695
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,074
I'm glad you're bonding
with your grandparents.

696
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:31,659
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

697
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:35,371
It's just weird for me, is all.
I just can't relate to it.

698
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:38,875
- You could if you tried.
- No. We're too...

699
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,711
Too much has happened.

700
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:45,214
I'm glad you are, anyway.

701
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:50,386
I didn't mean to cut you off from them
so completely, you know.

702
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:52,054
It just happened.

703
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:55,099
Not having them in my life
just felt so right.

704
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:57,393
I just never thought...

705
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,395
I'm sorry.

706
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,356
I did not pay $500 for this dress...

707
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:06,277
so you could run around and mess it up.
Now you sit and be still.

708
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,613
Cross your legs. You're a lady.

709
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:17,413
God, I must have had a million dresses
like that when I was a kid.

710
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:20,166
- It doesn't really scream "you."
- No.

711
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,960
I did all the screaming.

712
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:29,133
Thank you for not putting me
in a dress like that.

713
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:31,135
You're welcome.

714
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:34,472
Of course, wearing those dresses...
Not all bad.

715
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:37,350
Oh, no.
They really fly up when you twirl around.

716
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:41,395
And if you're wearing
that ruffled underwear, big crowd pleaser.

717
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:48,819
If it makes you feel better, I think
I got a fungus from the steam room.

718
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,781
It does. Thank you.

719
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,429
Oh, good. You're here.

720
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:16,806
Hi, Grandma.

721
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:19,642
- My goodness. What's that?
- We brought dessert.

722
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:22,520
- Really? How thoughtful! What is it?
- Blueberry shortcake.

723
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:26,148
- I've never heard of blueberry shortcake.
- It's a Stars Hollow specialty.

724
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:28,943
- Why is it already cut?
- It's left over.

725
00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:30,694
From the wedding.

726
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:32,029
At the inn.

727
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,364
I know where the wedding was.

728
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,616
Sorry. You were just doing
that staring thing.

729
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,495
- You brought us used dessert?
- It's not used. It's left over.

730
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:40,663
How nice.

731
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:44,458
I'll just put it in the kitchen
next to my half-empty box of cheer.

732
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,044
She's in a good mood tonight.

733
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:48,754
Can I get you a drink?

734
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,173
- White wine would be great.
- Coke.

735
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:55,803
Did Rory tell you all about
the wonderful time she had at the club?

736
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:59,306
- She sure did.
- Your father was simply flying all week.

737
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:02,643
- She really charmed him.
- Lf anybody could, it would be her.

738
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:06,063
In this age of MTV
and 100 television channels...

739
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:09,066
who would have thought
a girl could still get a thrill...

740
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,360
spending a simple afternoon
with her grandfather?

741
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:13,237
That wine would be real good right now.

742
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:16,282
I think we should consider
getting her a membership at the club.

743
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:17,449
If she wants, sure.

744
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,869
To have a place to go
where she can socialize.

745
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,745
That's very important to a young girl.

746
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:24,957
Now especially that the crack den
has closed down on the corner...

747
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,626
all her really good friends are gone.

748
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:32,214
What do you think,
should I pursue the career in comedy?

749
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,427
It's just very interesting
the way things turn out, isn't it?

750
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:39,180
Oh, you're here.

751
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:41,223
- Lorelai.
- Dad.

752
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,309
Rory, I have a surprise.

753
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,146
Not only did I find that copy of
Mencken's Chrestomathy we discussed...

754
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,815
I also found a first edition
of his memoirs as well.

755
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,776
- You're kidding.
- It's in my office if you'd like to see them.

756
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,029
Oh, my God, I totally would.

757
00:42:57,114 --> 00:42:59,825
I'd like to take a look at those myself.
