1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,720
Previously on Gilmore Girls. 

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,200
- Oh, my God, I'm going to Chilton?
- You did it, babe. You got in.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,680
- I told Mom you're changing schools.
- Is she thrilled?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,720
The party's on Friday.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Are you moving?

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,920
No, just my books are.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,160
- Ready?
- Yes.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
Headmaster Charleston will see you.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,240
You may have been the smartest
at Stars Hollow, but it's different here.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,600
You'll never catch up,
and you'll never beat me.

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,480
There's a good chance you will fail.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,240
- Who's that?
- New girl.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,040
Stay out of my way.
I will make this school a living hell for you.

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,120
See you tomorrow, Mary.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,880
- They kept calling me Mary.
- Mary, like Virgin Mary.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,080
What if I had looked like a slut?

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,640
They might have added
a "Magdalene" to it.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
- Shopping for school supplies. Party.
- Nobody demanded that you come.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you kidding?
How often do you do things like this?

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,400
While we're going crazy,
we should get toilet paper and a plunger.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,520
I'll do this later.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,560
- No, I'm teasing. Get that list of yours.
- Okay.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,600
- I need legal pads...
- Got it.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
...tons of pens, some number 2 pencils,
three highlighters, an eraser...

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,200
a staple remover, and a folder.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,400
- You need three highlighters?
- Yes.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,960
- That's a very random number.
- It is not random.

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,080
How did you get to the number three?

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
One dries up, one gets lost, I have one left.

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,880
- You've really thought this out.
- Yes.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,680
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,160
- Can we get back to the list?
- All right. Hey, legal pads.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,960
- No. Those are purple.
- Yes. Purple is festive.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,120
- I can't have purple.
- You can. They're on sale.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm going to a serious school.
I need serious paper.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
- Paper is paper.
- Not at Chilton.

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
- All right, fine. Here's your serious paper.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,360
And here are your somber highlighters,
your maudlin pencils...

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,680
- your manic-depressive pens.
- Mom.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,840
These erasers are on lithium.
So they seem cheerful...

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,160
but we caught them trying to
shove themselves in the pencil sharpener.

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,360
- I'm going home.
- No, wait.

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,760
We're gonna stage an intervention
with the neon Post-its...

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,080
and make them give up
their wacky, crazy ways.

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,040
You're never
coming shopping with me again.

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,360
Here's a card tray. Everything is gonna...

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,520
Decent effort by most.
Good effort by some.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
Exceptional effort by two.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Ms. Geller. Ms. Grant.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,360
Mr. Graham. Ms. Gilmore.

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,520
Take these home.
Learn from your mistakes.

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Look at the large red circles
around various parts of your papers...

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
as friendly reminders that to err is human.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,000
And that here at Chilton, we try to
beat that humanity right out of you.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Okay, next up, the test.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,600
The dreaded test. Shakespeare!

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,920
The man we've been droning on about
for the last three weeks...

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,800
finally comes back to haunt us on Friday.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,800
This is a big one, my friends.
Multiple-choice, with an essay section...

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,160
that will count for 20% of your grade
this semester.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,040
Don't be fooled by my kind face
and charming personality.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,520
This test will be hard,
and there will be no make-ups.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Refer to the study materials
I gave you at the beginning of the month...

64
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,920
and those extensive notes
I know you've been taking.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,640
- Hard paper.
- Killer.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
- How did you do?
- "A."

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Me, too!

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,720
- Small world.
- Isn't it?

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
- Madeline, what did you get?
- You know I got a "B."

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,280
- A "B's" not bad. It's respectable even.
- Not at all.

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
I'd be proud.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,960
A "D," however,
that would be cause for concern.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
A cry for help.

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
A job application at McDonald's.

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
"Would you like fries with that?"

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
Hey, you know,
not everybody can be smart.

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,520
As my mother always says,
"Somebody has to answer the phones."

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,960
I have no idea
what you two are talking about.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,200
No, but Rory does.

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,320
Hey, Mary!

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
And it just keeps getting better.

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,320
- You look sad.
- I'm fine.

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,520
- Bad grade?
- I have to go.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Mary, I just can't figure out
why we're not friends.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
I think it's because I make you nervous.

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,560
I think it's because
you can't learn my name.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,800
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- None of your business.

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,400
- Is that a no?
- Is there no one else you can bother?

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,680
I think you like me.
You just don't know how to say it.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,880
- So what are you doing Friday night?
- I'm busy.

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,320
What, you gotta be back
at the convent by 5:00?

92
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Please leave me alone.

93
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,480
All right. Since you said "please."

94
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,080
Later, Mary.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,360
- You imbecile!
- Back off, chevalier.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
- You're stupid, blind, and clumsy.
- At least I'm not French.

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
- What's going on?
- She ran over my shoe.

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,840
- He got in the way.
- You aimed for me.

99
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,480
- Hold on.
- She scratched my shoes.

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,120
- What a baby.
- These are $300 Italian loafers.

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,360
I wonder if Versace makes a pacifier.

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
- You're fired.
- You can't fire me.

103
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,280
- Then I dock your pay. Can I kill her?
- Not before high tea.

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,840
Fine. Then I will curse you constantly
and in several languages.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,680
- I'm going for the other foot.
- Don't! Drella, to your corner now.

106
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
I win.

107
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Michel, you're a grown man.
Now go to your desk and act like one.

108
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,640
- Okay, just a minute.
- I've got it.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
The review?

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
- It's here.
- Where is it?

112
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,120
- I'm looking.
- Hurry.

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Behold, in theaters now,
The Thing That Reads A Lot.

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,800
- Chocolate?
- Glass measuring cup.

115
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,640
- Lorelai, look.
- I'm sorry.

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,520
- Jeez, who's naked?
- Lucien Mills, food critic.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah? How's his butt?

118
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,280
He was supposed to review the restaurant.
Here it is.

119
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,280
Is it good? Is he mean? Should I cry?

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
Here we go.

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,880
"The words "divine,"
"delectable," and "delirious"..."

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,320
"don't begin to describe
the delicious experience..."

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,560
"of dining at the Independence Inn."
I'm smelling rave.

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,680
Really?

125
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,320
"Only Chef Sookie St. James
could make a simple salad..."

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,040
"of hothouse tomatoes and assorted fresh
herbs seem like a religious experience."

127
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,720
"Her lobster bisque is worth
every sinful, cream-filled, rich sip."

128
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,560
See, I don't use that much cream. I just
use a very concentrated lobster stock.

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,000
- And it really makes it...
- He's not here.

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Okay, go on.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
"The entrees are
as heavenly as the starters."

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,720
"Though the much-lauded risotto
was perfectly fine..."

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,960
"it was the handkerchief pasta
with brown sage in a butter sauce..."

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,840
"that sent me through the roof."

135
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,240
This is unbelievable! I'm gonna
have this framed for the dining room!

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,400
Yeah, that'd be swell.
Can I see that again?

137
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,720
So we should celebrate tonight, huh?
Girls on the town?

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
I can't. I have to study.

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,160
I should really get started
on this shopping list.

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,840
What is going on here?
We are young and fiery women.

141
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,360
Studying? Shopping lists?

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,720
Where's "To hell with it all"?
Where's "Throwing caution to the wind"?

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Where... Shoot, the linen delivery.

144
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,800
You go, girl.

145
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,240
...and the Person of the Week segment.

146
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,600
- News is on!
- One sec.

147
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,800
For our top story tonight, a grisly,
horrible thing happened in a small town...

148
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
where no grisly, horrible things
ever happen. Everyone's shocked!

149
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
House slides down hill.
Liposuction kills. Stay fat.

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
Hey, let's get ice cream. I'm bored.

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,440
Hello?

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
Mom, I'm studying.

153
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,480
But I'm talking ice cream.
Can't you take a break?

154
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,920
- I can't take a break right now.
- Okay. When?

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,680
- Are you four?
- No, I'm hungry.

156
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,680
- Have some more pizza.
- It's cold.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,760
- Heat it up.
- It's not the same.

158
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,760
Lorelai, go to your room!

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,840
Wow, smart girls are mean.

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,760
If you let me study now,
I'll play with you this weekend.

161
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,680
- Promise?
- Yes. We can do anything you want.

162
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,640
- Will you go to the shoe sale with me?
- Yes.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
- Will you let me try on anything I want?
- Yes.

164
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,520
Will you help push people away
if they go for my size?

165
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
I'll even run interference for you.

166
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,960
- All right, you've got a deal.
- Good.

167
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,880
So, I'm sorry. Where did we land
on the whole ice cream issue?

168
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,720
What?

169
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,440
- Right or left?
- Left.

170
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I thought you said left.

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
- Sorry. My left, your right.
- Okay.

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,640
Marco.

173
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Polo.

174
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
Hey, Marco.

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
Hey, Polo.

176
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,720
- You're late.
- Sorry.

177
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
What is that?

178
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,360
12 calories.

179
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
- Here.
- Oh, my God. Bless you.

180
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
- Man, what's that?
- My notes.

181
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,080
Really?

182
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,640
I don't think Shakespeare
knew himself this well.

183
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
I like. How much?

184
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
- $500.
- Is that the best you can do?

185
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,760
- $450.
- I'm not so sure.

186
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,080
$375 and you take it right now.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
- Sold.
- We appreciate your business.

188
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
Move.

189
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
I really miss Stars Hollow High.

190
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Chilton's just...

191
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
I don't know, hard.

192
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,400
What do you care? You were always
Miss Everything's-So-Easy-At-School.

193
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
This should be a snap for you.

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Nope. This is sold. Move.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,280
- What's that?
- That's mine.

196
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,640
That is chocolate-covered death.

197
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,280
With a creamy caramel surprise.

198
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,200
- So, this guy asked about you today.
- What guy?

199
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,080
The new kid. Tall, perfect.

200
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,160
- What did he want to know?
- Where you were.

201
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,280
What did you say?

202
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,160
I told him you were too smart for us
and you had to go to the genius school.

203
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,560
He really liked that.
I guess he's into brainy chicks.

204
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,520
I'll keep my eyes open for one for him.

205
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,560
- No. Sold. Move.
- Mom.

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,280
- Where do you want us to go?
- Library.

207
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,520
I hate sales.

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,640
No Black Sabbath.

209
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,960
No one's listening.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,360
No Black Sabbath, no Steely Dan,
no Boston, and no Queen.

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,680
What happened to make you so cold?

212
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,800
- You like that Mozart.
- I am the Artie Shaw of harpists.

213
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,400
- Sookie, I need coffee to go.
- There's fresh over there.

214
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,520
Good.

215
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Fresh in my first lifetime as Joan of Arc.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,920
Sorry. I thought I made fresh. Here.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,520
Bless you. I'm so exhausted,
and I have to drive to Hartford tonight...

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
- to go to a parent-teacher meeting.
- Sounds great.

219
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
This school is so different
from Stars Hollow.

220
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,400
They send home a thousand pages
of updates every week.

221
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,520
It's a very intense place.

222
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Last week, there was this huge debate...

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,240
over whether plaid scrunchies
were acceptable headwear.

224
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,800
People took sides. Things got ugly.
The scrunchy motion finally passed...

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,400
- and I like to think I was the tiebreaker.
- That's nice.

226
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?

227
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,840
- He said it was fine.
- Who said it was fine?

228
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,880
- Lucien Mills.
- The restaurant critic?

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,520
- He said my risotto was fine.
- Isn't it?

230
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
No, it's not fine.

231
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,120
Fine is a word you use
when someone stops you on the street...

232
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
that you know,
but you don't want to talk to.

233
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,160
They ask you how you are,
and you say "Fine."

234
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,200
That's enough so they don't have to keep
talking to you, "cause they don't want to.

235
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,760
Then they can feel good because
they've been considerate enough to ask...

236
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,080
and if, God forbid,
something actually is wrong...

237
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,360
they'll sit down, take time and listen,
even if they don't want to.

238
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I don't think he meant fine
as a slam or as a monologue.

239
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,640
He couldn't have meant it any other way.

240
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
I hate to see you get so upset
over one little review.

241
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,720
This is pride, Lorelai.
I mean, you know about this risotto.

242
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,520
- On my mother's deathbed...
- You made the risotto...

243
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,680
- and she lived three more years.
- She was supposed to be dead.

244
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
The doctor said
she wouldn't live through the night.

245
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,640
And she lived because of the risotto,
the magic risotto.

246
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,280
And this guy had the nerve to say
it was fine.

247
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I don't think he knew the story.

248
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay. Before you get all goofy on me,
I don't have your porcinis.

249
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
I forgot them.

250
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,440
I don't have any other excuse,
other than plain, old, stupid human error.

251
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,960
I have the morels, which I know you
don't want, so come on, let me have it.

252
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,640
Morels are fine.

253
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,560
Did anyone else feel the shift
in the space-time continuum?

254
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,200
- A reviewer didn't like the risotto.
- The magic risotto? You're kidding.

255
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,040
I gotta go.
So try and cheer her up, would you?

256
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
Sure.

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,680
Sweetie, please don't worry about it.
Everyone knows you're the best.

258
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
So...

259
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,760
I hear the huckleberry crop"s
gonna totally suck this year.

260
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,640
We are gonna be focusing
on Elizabethan literature.

261
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,360
Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon,
Ben Jonson, John Webster.

262
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,760
Is Marlowe really that significant?

263
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,720
We want to give
as complete an overview as possible.

264
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Yes, but will he be included
on the advanced placement test?

265
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,320
We can't know exactly
what will be on the AP test...

266
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,040
but it will be important
when your kids hit their universities.

267
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,560
But to get there
they need to pass the AP test.

268
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,560
Right, it's all important.
It could all be on the test.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
How do we find out?

270
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,160
You could bribe somebody
on the AP Committee.

271
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,240
I was kidding. I'm just kidding.

272
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm so sorry.
I had a terrible pothole incident.

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,480
You don't care. So please, go on.

274
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,200
What in the world?

275
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,640
You okay?

276
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,080
- I'll just sit now.
- I don't think we've met.

277
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm Lorelai Gilmore. Rory's mom.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,920
Glad you could join us.
Rory's one of our new students.

279
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,160
How nice. Now, the AP test.

280
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,720
Right. Well, we are preparing them
as best we can.

281
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,640
I've hired a tutor for Bethany.

282
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,560
Always a valid option.

283
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,600
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the camel!

284
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
This is really bad coffee.

285
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,600
So, this AP test,
what are we gonna do about it?

286
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,760
The next test is scheduled for next month.

287
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,000
The 25th, Saturday, at 7:00 a.m.

288
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,680
- Ms. Gilmore?
- Where is the test?

289
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,520
- It will be given here.
- Here?

290
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,160
- Right.
- Great.

291
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
- Any other questions?
- Yeah.

292
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,520
Can parents come?

293
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,480
What?

294
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah, it's a big, exciting test.
So I just thought...

295
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,240
- I'm sorry. Is that stupid?
- No, it's not stupid.

296
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,640
I just thought
I'd like to see the excitement.

297
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,360
- It's a test.
- Yeah, I know.

298
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,000
What's exciting about a test?

299
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,720
- Do you play golf?
- Yes, I do.

300
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,280
- You explain yours, I'll explain mine.
- Why not get back to the meeting?

301
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,760
That's the one who voted
for the scrunchies.

302
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,960
Must be a scholarship student.

303
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,320
Excuse me.

304
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,320
You know what? I think this would be
a good time for a break.

305
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,480
There's coffee in the back.

306
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,120
What were you gonna do? Hit her?

307
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
No. I had some
good verbal comebacks ready.

308
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,560
- It just keeps getting worse.
- Not drinking it is always an option.

309
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,040
Not in my world.

310
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,520
- I'm Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

311
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,320
I apologize for the behavior
of some of our guests tonight.

312
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
It's a tense time for some people.

313
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,560
- The SAT season?
- The waking hours.

314
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,080
- Are you this nice to my kid?
- It's easy.

315
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
- Rory's a sweet girl.
- Yeah, she is.

316
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,000
How is she liking Chilton?

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,280
- She loves it.
- Really?

318
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,200
Yeah. It's an adjustment, of course.
But she's always wanted to go to Harvard.

319
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,920
- This is how she'll get there.
- Harvard?

320
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,320
Ever since she could crawl,
I've really wanted her to go there.

321
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,560
It's a great school.

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
I bought her a Harvard sweatshirt
when she was four.

323
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
Of course, it was way too big for her.

324
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,160
So she used it as a blanket for a while,
and then as a diaper on this shopping trip.

325
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,920
And now I've told you a story
that would so mortify her...

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,960
she'll kill me
when she finds out you know.

327
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,800
- Don't tell her then. It'll be our secret.
- I appreciate that.

328
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,240
So, are you a B-52's girl?

329
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,360
What?

330
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,120
No, I'm a klutz girl who should not drive
with coffee in her hand.

331
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,640
I had this in the car.

332
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,560
I hope Rory adjusts to this place.
We need her here.

333
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
Thank you. That's so nice.

334
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,200
I hope she's not too disappointed
about her paper.

335
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,880
It's very hard to catch up
on all that reading material.

336
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
- I know a "D" seems pretty dismal...
- Rory got a "D"?

337
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,520
- Yeah, but...
- She's never gotten a "D."

338
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,960
It's the first paper she's turning in.
She's bound to falter a little.

339
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,520
This totally explains
the no ice-cream thing.

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- The ice-cream thing?

341
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,400
Look, I've gotta go.

342
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,920
I'm sorry if I said something to offend you.

343
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,520
No. If Rory got a "D,"
she's not feeling too good right now.

344
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,760
- And I'd really like to be there.
- I understand.

345
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
So, it was nice meeting you.

346
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
You, too.

347
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,000
- Keep up the good work.
- I will.

348
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,280
- Don't ever make coffee ever again.
- I won"t, I promise.

349
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,640
Thanks.

350
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

351
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,160
- Here.
- What's that?

352
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
- You look like you need pie.
- I do?

353
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,680
Violent pencil-tossing
usually signals a need for pie.

354
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
What if I'd thrown a pen?

355
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,840
- I would've brought you a trout.
- What?

356
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,360
I don't make the rules,
I just carry them out.

357
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Hey, backwards baseball hat.
New look for you.

358
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
She's eating pie?
Did she even have dinner?

359
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,120
You raised her. I just serve.

360
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,640
- Hello, bookworm.
- Finally.

361
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,920
- Where were you?
- Well, actually, I was in Hartford.

362
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,560
Why?

363
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
I was there for the...

364
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,920
Parent-teacher meeting.
Oh, my God, I forgot.

365
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,280
It went very well.

366
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,560
I was extremely charming.
I won the whole crowd over.

367
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,360
They made me queen.

368
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,800
So, I guess you talked to Mr. Medina.

369
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,880
Why did you let me whine
about ice cream and shoe sales...

370
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,080
when you had something major going on?

371
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
I know.

372
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
I hate when I'm an idiot and don't know it.
I like to be aware of my idiocy.

373
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,120
To revel in it, take pictures. We've missed
a prime Christmas-card opportunity.

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,560
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
You should have told me.

376
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
I couldn"t.

377
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,080
You couldn't tell me?
You tell me everything.

378
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,680
It was too humiliating.

379
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,280
Honey, you once told me that you loved
Saved By the Bell.

380
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,960
What could be more humiliating than that?

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,040
I couldn't form the words.

382
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
I couldn't even say it.
I couldn't even comprehend it.

383
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,160
It was a "D." I got a "D."

384
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,800
- I've never gotten a "D." Ever.
- I know.

385
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,760
Even when I broke my arm
and couldn't write for a month...

386
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,320
I got an "A" minus.

387
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,040
- That was a different school.
- I know. It was Stars Hollow High.

388
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,240
A "D" at Stars Hollow
is like an "F" at Chilton.

389
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
It's worse. It's like a "G" or a "W."

390
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,880
So I'm guessing
the spelling test didn't go well either?

391
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,120
A "D."

392
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
I suck.

393
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,360
You don't suck.

394
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,960
- I can't do this.
- Listen, a "D" is bad, okay?

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,040
But this talk about "I suck,"
"I can't do this," and self-pity...

396
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,320
that's worse. That's not you.
You didn't feel sorry for yourself...

397
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,080
when it took you three months
to learn how to ride a bike.

398
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,560
Four months.

399
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,280
It took me four months
to learn how to ride a bike.

400
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Really? Four months?

401
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,320
Yeah. You wanna
belabor the conversation?

402
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,880
Forget about the bike.

403
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,920
Listen, a "D" is one grade.
It's not the end of the world.

404
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,320
You'll catch up, you'll do better.
You are of hardy, stubborn stock.

405
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,680
If there's one thing I gave you,
it's stubbornness.

406
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,280
- I'm not stubborn.
- You are.

407
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,840
- I'm not.
- Fine. You're not.

408
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

409
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
You can do this, and I'll help you.
I'll get you through this.

410
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Now put the "D" behind you.

411
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,960
- What's next?
- I have a test on Friday.

412
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,520
- A test. Great!
- On Shakespeare.

413
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,680
The bard with a beard. Love it.

414
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,400
- It's 20% of my grade.
- Just makes life interesting.

415
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,640
Now what do we have to do
to get you an "A" on that test?

416
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,240
Do you really think I can do this?

417
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,000
I bet you $1.

418
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
That's it? That's all my future's worth, $1?

419
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,360
Well, you did get a "D."

420
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,800
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments

421
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,280
"Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds

422
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,640
"Or bends with the remover to remove

423
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,200
"O, no! It is an ever-fixed mark

424
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,920
"That looks on tempests
and is never shaken

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,320
"It is the star to every wandering bark

426
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,840
"Whose worth's unknown
although his height be taken"

427
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
You're going down.

428
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
Sookie, do you know
what the menu's gonna be...

429
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,080
- Good?
- Hot.

430
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,840
Wait. I got another one.

431
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
- Better?
- Hotter.

432
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Wait. I got one more.

433
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,680
What's with all the risotto?
Have we gone theme now?

434
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,240
Is it gonna be like the Scotch tape store?

435
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Look, I've made 40 recipes, okay? 40.

436
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,920
And every single time,
I come back to the same conclusion.

437
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,320
That yours is better.

438
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
- Yes.
- It is.

439
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
- You were looking for me?
- Yes!

440
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,840
Three weeks ago,
a guy comes in here, Lucien Mills...

441
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,760
orders the risotto, doesn't like it.

442
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,360
- The magic risotto? You're kidding.
- Not helping.

443
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
He's a restaurant critic.

444
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,400
He ordered lots of things,
probably didn't finish them.

445
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,160
In his review,
he said his waiter had a goatee.

446
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,240
You've got a goatee,
so you waited on him, and I need info.

447
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,280
- What did he look like?
- Like he was unhappy with the risotto!

448
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
Maybe he had an annoying companion...

449
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,280
that wouldn't let him
concentrate on his eating.

450
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,640
- I serve a lot of people.
- He had a beard, false teeth, or a wig...

451
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,680
or the glasses with the big nose.

452
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
- May I be fired now?
- Absolutely.

453
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,640
What about a guy with
an annoying companion and a fake wig...

454
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
sitting underneath
an air-conditioning vent...

455
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
next to a woman
with too much perfume on?

456
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,040
- The Comedy of Errors: Written?
- 1590.

457
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,800
- Published?
- 1698.

458
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,560
- 1623. Close.
- How is 1623 close?

459
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,800
- You got the 16 part right.
- I was off by 75 years.

460
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
Anything under 100 is close.

461
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,640
- What kind of a rule is that?
- I'm running the study session here.

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,080
- Okay. Richard III.
- 1591.

463
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
"93?"96?

464
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,560
Okay, that's getting really annoying now.

465
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,760
Go on. I'm listening.

466
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,560
The sonnets are 154 poems of 14 lines.

467
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,200
- Except?
- Except for 126, which is 12 lines.

468
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
Good.

469
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,640
They're written in iambic pentameter.

470
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,640
- Except?
- Except for 145, which is in tetrameter.

471
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,520
- Rock on, sister.
- Really?

472
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,080
- Not one mistake. How do you feel?
- Nauseous.

473
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't think the fries
and the horseradish sauce...

474
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,720
was the best idea we ever had.

475
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,880
It was satisfying in the moment, though.

476
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,120
You're gonna
blow that class away tomorrow.

477
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,680
- You think?
- I think.

478
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,560
What do you say we call it a night
and get some beauty sleep?

479
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,000
You go. I wanna review my notes
one more time.

480
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,400
- That's okay. I'll stay up.
- Mom, go to sleep.

481
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
No. I'm not even tired.
I was just thinking of you.

482
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
No!

483
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,080
Oh, jeez.
This was such a bad sleeping idea.

484
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,560
- I'm late!
- What?

485
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,880
- I'm late! I woke up late!
- Rory, calm down.

486
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,920
I can't calm down!
I missed my bus! Get up!

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
Mommy can't get up right now.

488
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,440
Mommy's been sleeping
at a right angle all night.

489
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,280
- I'm gonna miss the test!
- No, you're not.

490
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,760
I'll get the keys.
We'll go right now. Let's go!

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,840
- I can't take you.
- You have to!

492
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,240
- I have a meeting at the Inn at 8:00!
- Mom!

493
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,800
Okay, wait. Think. Listen. Here. You drive.

494
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,480
- What?
- You drive. I'll get a ride from Sookie.

495
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,320
Take the phone. Take the keys. Go!

496
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,520
- Are you sure?
- Go!

497
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,440
- I'm gone!
- Good luck!

498
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,720
Hello?

499
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,920
Did I leave a set of notes at your house?

500
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,040
- Where are you?
- I'm driving to school.

501
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,000
I need to check something
and I can't find some of my notes.

502
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
Okay, hold on. Let me check.

503
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,040
- I don't see anything.
- What did I do with them?

504
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,560
- Maybe it's downstairs in the store?
- Maybe. I just...

505
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,200
- Oh, my God!
- Are you all right?

506
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,240
- I just got hit by a deer!
- You hit a deer?

507
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,880
- No! I got hit by a deer.
- How do you get hit by a deer?

508
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,800
I was at a stop sign, and he hit me!
Oh, my God!

509
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,280
Was it a four-way stop?

510
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,640
- What does that matter?
- I don't know.

511
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,480
I don't know what to ask
after you've been hit by a deer.

512
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,760
- I don't see him.
- Put salt down. Deer love salt.

513
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,520
- Where am I gonna get salt?
- Do you have a lunch?

514
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,080
- Lane!
- Sorry.

515
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,080
I don't see him anywhere.
What if he's hurt?

516
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
Rory, your test.

517
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,800
- What time is it?
- It's 7:40.

518
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,880
No!

519
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,400
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,960
Everyone back to your tests.

521
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,640
- You've to wait in the library.
- What about the test?

522
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
- You've missed the test.
- No.

523
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
We start class promptly at 8:05.
That's when I need people in their seats.

524
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,720
- Please.
- I'm sorry. It's the rules.

525
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,520
But you don't understand.
I was up all night studying...

526
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,840
and then I missed my bus.
So I had to drive.

527
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,640
- Let's discuss this outside.
- So, I'm driving, and I get hit by a deer.

528
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,200
- You hit a deer?
- No, I got hit by a deer.

529
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,440
You don't believe me?
I've got antler prints on the car.

530
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,520
Come on.

531
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
No! You have to let me take this test!
I'm ready for it.

532
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,440
- I know everything about Shakespeare.
- You've to calm down now.

533
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,680
- I know his birthday, his mother's name...
- Loser.

534
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,400
And just what is wrong with you?

535
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,800
You already have everything.
You have the grades and the status.

536
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,120
What's wrong with you...

537
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,920
that you have this need
to be the biggest jerk in the world?

538
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let's go.

539
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,360
What's up, quippy? Why so silent?

540
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,880
Outside, now.

541
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,880
And, for the last time, the name is Rory!

542
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,880
Make sure that carpet is replaced perfectly
before they go.

543
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,480
- Okay.
- Perfectly, nailed down and everything.

544
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,840
You mean that "perfectly."
I thought you meant the other "perfectly."

545
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,960
The one that could be misinterpreted
by the other Michel...

546
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,880
the one who couldn't understand
what you meant by "perfectly."

547
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,720
- What do you think about Pat Benatar?
- Great idea. Can she play the harp?

548
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,560
I knew it! I found it!

549
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,480
- You found what?
- I found his bill!

550
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,640
What are you talking about?

551
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
It wasn't the risotto, it was the wine.
He ordered the wrong wine!

552
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,920
Great.

553
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,520
In the review,
he mentioned a summer tomato salad...

554
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,760
which I only made once
in the last three weeks...

555
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,280
because Jackson decides to
get in a fistfight with his tomato grower...

556
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,520
- Okay, that's a different story.
- Yes. Save it for Christmastime.

557
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Brian, the goateed waiter,
only worked one shift last week...

558
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
because his girlfriend kicked him out.

559
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
- Celia kicked him out?
- He didn't want kids.

560
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,520
- But she knew that.
- Women think they can change men.

561
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah.

562
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,200
So, I checked the dates,
and narrowed the day down...

563
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,600
and found a party that had ordered
practically everything including...

564
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,320
- The magic risotto.
- Yes, the risotto and a Riesling. A Riesling!

565
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,920
Why not drink battery acid?

566
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,760
Exactly. Changes the entire flavor
of the dish.

567
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,200
The fact that Brian served it...

568
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,400
makes me think
Celia is better off without him.

569
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,840
I'm so glad, hon.

570
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,240
Okay. Here are the zucchini.

571
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,360
Too small. Take them away.

572
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,920
- It's good to have her back, huh?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,040
You're still gonna have to pay
for the zucchini.

574
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,760
There's a man with a funny accent
on the phone, asking for you.

575
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,200
Really? Did you guys exchange
the secret handshake?

576
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,840
Lorelai here.

577
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,560
Rory, what happened?

578
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,800
- I got hit by a deer.
- You got what?

579
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,480
Then I was late,
and they wouldn't let me take the test.

580
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,440
- What?
- They wouldn't let me take the test...

581
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,600
- No, you're kidding me.
- Mom...

582
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,040
No, it's okay. Just sit right here.
I'll handle this.

583
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,840
Excuse me. Hello.

584
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,280
- Ms. Gilmore. Please come in.
- Thank you.

585
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,440
Have a seat.

586
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,080
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

587
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,960
Rory told me that
she wasn't allowed to take her test.

588
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,400
- She was late.
- Right, well...

589
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,720
see, there were circumstances
beyond her control.

590
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,680
Rory is never late.
She's almost annoyingly on time.

591
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,960
If you checked your records...

592
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,240
Past performance has nothing to do
with today's situation.

593
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,320
Okay. But see,
she was up all night studying.

594
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,120
I was there. She has a witness.

595
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,280
- She's not on trial here.
- Well, Your Honor...

596
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,520
Just a little trial humor.
That won't happen again.

597
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,120
She got up late.
She broke her neck to get here.

598
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
We don't live locally as you...

599
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,800
- "The dog ate my homework."
- Excuse me?

600
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,160
"My computer crashed,
and I lost my midterm."

601
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,440
I wasn't making excuses.

602
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,400
"My grandmother and first cousin died."

603
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,080
"My sister took my report to school
instead of hers."

604
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,800
"My religion prohibits studying
after sundown."

605
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,680
"I went blind last night, but I'm fine now."

606
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,240
That's not Rory.

607
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,240
Rules are rules.

608
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,880
When you're late,
you forfeit the right to take the test.

609
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,680
Where are you going? Where is he going?

610
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,360
Please, believe me,
if I could do anything, I would.

611
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,520
- You could let her take the test.
- I can"t.

612
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
That's not fair.

613
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,360
We're not here to be fair.
We're here to educate.

614
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,560
Yes, and I'm asking you
to please educate my kid.

615
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,760
We will when she's on time.

616
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,280
Have a nice day.

617
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,520
Are you holding that door open
for a reason?

618
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,560
- Our meeting is over.
- Like hell it is.

619
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,200
Do you have any idea
what we have gone through this week?

620
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,880
We have been up all night every night,
studying. We haven't slept.

621
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,680
We haven't talked about anything else...

622
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,320
except this school and this test
for seven days.

623
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,520
We have stretched ourselves
as thin as humanly possible...

624
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,160
without going completely postal.
My God! We're just one person!

625
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,320
Why don't we narrow
our field of conversation down to Rory?

626
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Okay. Why don't we?

627
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,840
You sit here in your snotty little school...

628
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,000
in desperate need
of some extra heating vents...

629
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,440
and you nurture horrible kids
who treat each other like mortal enemies.

630
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,120
You set impossible standards...

631
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,640
that make normal people
feel less than everybody else.

632
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,320
You take a great kid like Rory
and tear her apart!

633
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't think that's completely fair.

634
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,280
You say she's smart and she'll do fine.

635
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,640
And this rotting, stodgy rathole
could use somebody like her.

636
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,920
Then you completely shut her out of a test
that she's crammed for...

637
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,640
that she completely deserves to take!

638
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,840
- I didn't call this place a rathole.
- That's true. I added that.

639
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,480
Wouldn't want you to get
in trouble with II Duce here.

640
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,680
I thought this place
was gonna be so great.

641
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,680
And now, I guess this goes on
the "Boy, was I wrong" list...

642
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,720
right above gauchos
but just below the Flashdance phase.

643
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,360
My goodness,
you do like to throw fits in your family.

644
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,600
What are you talking about?

645
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Your daughter threw a similar, if not
as manic, fit of her own this morning.

646
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,960
Please. Rory doesn't throw fits.

647
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,600
She's the most even-tempered person
I know.

648
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,960
Well, she did a lovely impression of you.

649
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,680
Everything you said in your rant
was absolutely true...

650
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,320
without the colorful embellishments
of course.

651
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,560
We do set impossible standards...

652
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,440
and such standards do foster
highly competitive children.

653
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,880
However, that is life, and that is Chilton.

654
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,400
Rules can change. You can change them.

655
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,040
I told your daughter when she came here,
this place was not for everyone...

656
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,440
and might not be for her.
I will now tell you the same thing.

657
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,320
She doesn't have to be here.

658
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,480
She doesn't have to go to Harvard.
Maybe she shouldn"t.

659
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,640
If she can't handle the pressure,
she should leave.

660
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,800
You need to take your daughter home now
and decide what it is you intend to do.

661
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,440
However, another outburst like this
from either of you...

662
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,800
will not be on the options list.

663
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,840
Thank you for coming in.

664
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,200
That will be all.

665
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,440
You got hit by a deer?

666
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,720
You did. You got hit by a deer.

667
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,760
It just came out of nowhere.

668
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,320
You couldn't just run into a wall
like other kids?

669
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,680
- Can we just go home, please?
- Yeah, sure. Jump in.

670
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,640
- May I help you?
- Yes.

671
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,280
Hello. My name is Sookie St. James.
I'm the chef at the Independence Inn.

672
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,960
- I know who you are.
- You do?

673
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,240
Well, I'm flattered.
You write about a lot of chefs...

674
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,360
- What are you doing here?
- Right.

675
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,920
I know that this
is a terrible intrusion, but...

676
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,720
- Are you cooking?
- I'm making chicken.

677
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,920
- You used too much salt.
- I did not.

678
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
It smells salty.

679
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,160
- I'm closing the door now.
- No, wait.

680
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,040
I found your address
from my network of culinary friends...

681
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,480
This is really inappropriate.
I gave you a good review.

682
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,280
I suggest you go home.

683
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,760
I don't care about the review. I just...

684
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,280
I want you to try this dish...

685
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,160
with this wine.

686
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,480
I'll wait.

687
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,760
- Quite a day, huh?
- I don't want to talk. Please.

688
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,560
Okay.

689
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,520
I just think we should talk about it.

690
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,760
- Stop the car.
- What?

691
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
Here. Stop here.

692
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,760
You're just feeling like
an impromptu nature walk?

693
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
I wanna see if it's all right.

694
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,320
- Lf what's all right?
- The deer.

695
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,240
- You're never gonna find the deer!
- I'm gonna try.

696
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,320
- I'm in heels.
- Stay in the car.

697
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,320
It's dangerous in the car
with the kamikaze deer running around.

698
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,080
I have to find it.

699
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,080
All right. Wait up!

700
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,040
So what does the deer look like?

701
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,160
Does he have any distinguishing marks...

702
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,920
besides the word "jeep"
imprinted on his forehead?

703
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,600
He's just a deer.

704
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,400
So I had a nice chat
with Headmaster Charleston today.

705
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,000
He said you went ballistic in class.

706
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,720
I was just tired.

707
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,360
You wouldn't have been tired
had you not been killing yourself all week.

708
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,240
I was studying. I didn't have a choice.

709
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,520
Maybe you shouldn't be studying
that hard.

710
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,960
- What are you talking about?
- You're 16.

711
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,560
You should get some sleep
and eat a real meal...

712
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
and come up for air once in a while.

713
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
They kicked me out.

714
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,880
No. Of course not.
They love you. This is coming from me.

715
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,520
Are you saying I should quit?

716
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,840
I'm saying, if you wanted to go back
to your other school with Lane...

717
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,800
that would be fine with me.

718
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,480
- You don't think I can do it.
- You know that's not true.

719
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,360
I think you can do anything.
But you don't lose it in class.

720
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
That's not part of
the Rory personality description.

721
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,520
If you're losing it in class...

722
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,240
because you're tired, stressed out,
or working too hard...

723
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm worried about that. I have to be.

724
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,560
- I lost it once.
- Okay. Fine.

725
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,480
It's just I can't remember a time...

726
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,320
when we weren't talking about
you going to Harvard.

727
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,040
It was just a given.
That was what we were working for.

728
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,880
- Everything went in that direction.
- I know.

729
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,800
And I'm forgetting where that all started.

730
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,640
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...

731
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,920
did it start with me
or did it start with you?

732
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,240
Was it my dream
that you went to Harvard?

733
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Mom.

734
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Because I never got to do
the big, fancy college thing.

735
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,920
Maybe all this time I'm thinking
it's all for Rory...

736
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,880
when really it wasn"t.

737
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,680
- I'm not doing this because of you.
- Lf you are, you don't have to.

738
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,720
- I know that.
- I'll still love you...

739
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,720
even if you can't support me
in my old age...

740
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,600
in the fabulous manner
to which I plan on growing accustomed.

741
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,840
I'll remember that selfless gesture.
Thank you.

742
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,320
- I just want you to be happy.
- I am.

743
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,720
No, I want you to be...

744
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,760
dancing-through-the-woods-crazy happy.

745
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,480
If Harvard and Chilton
is not gonna do that for you...

746
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,920
then forget about them.

747
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
I was just behind.

748
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,320
I never caught up on all the reading.
That's why I got a "D."

749
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,680
I can catch up. I will catch up.
And when I do, everything will be fine.

750
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
No. Harvard is my dream.

751
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,920
- I want it more than anything. I swear.
- Yeah, but...

752
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,800
I appreciate all that you're saying. I do.

753
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,800
But I'm not ready to
give up on Chilton yet.

754
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,120
Fair enough.

755
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,560
I do, however,
reserve the right to change my mind.

756
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,160
That's your prerogative,
as long as you remain a woman.

757
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
- Thanks, though.
- For what?

758
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,520
For yelling at the headmaster
the way you did.

759
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I didn't yell at him.

760
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,400
You called him II Duce.

761
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,520
Which means "kind sir" in Cantonese.

762
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

763
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,160
How much longer are we gonna
look for this crazy deer?

764
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Just a little further.

765
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,920
- I just hope he didn't hurt himself.
- I just hope he has insurance.

766
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,400
Go get that plaid skirt off
and grab your books.

767
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,760
We're going to Luke"s.

768
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,600
- Don't you have to get back to work?
- They can last a little longer without me.

769
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,120
Plus Michel gets so cute
when he feels he's overworked.

770
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,480
His ears puff out, his nostrils flare.
It's big fun.

771
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,040
- Go.
- I'm gone.

772
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,560
It's us. We're not here.
We have a life. Get over it.

773
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,760
Hi. This is a message for Rory.
It's Max Medina calling.

774
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,680
I just wanted to say
I talked to Headmaster Charleston...

775
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,600
or II Duce, as he's more affectionately
known in the Gilmore household...

776
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,160
and he's agreed to let you do
some extra credit work...

777
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,480
to help make up for the missed test today.

778
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,400
Now, I'm not sure
what the extra credit work is yet...

779
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,280
but it probably will be time-consuming
and extremely painful.

780
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,840
It will, however, get you back up to
where I think you rightly belong, Rory.

781
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,520
Don't lose heart. Make this work.

782
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,320
And if your mother's listening...

783
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,160
Lorelai, it was a pleasure
encountering you.

784
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,200
I hope it happens again.

785
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
Anyway, see you in class. Bye.
