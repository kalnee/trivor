1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,362
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:08,325
Don't move, please.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,761
Why are you insisting on doing this?

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,933
Because you're starting
private school tomorrow.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,409
Yes, but I'm gonna be wearing shoes.
Nobody's gonna see my feet.

6
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:21,913
Okay, but everybody knows
that private school girls are bad.

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,847
And bad girls always wear red nail polish.

8
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,012
Are you nervous?

9
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,648
- About what?
- About starting Chilton.

10
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:35,053
I wasn't until I heard about
all those bad girls.

11
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,758
Guys! New CD!
XTC, Apple Venus Volume 2!

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,093
- Good!
- But you only finished half my toes.

13
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:45,099
Who cares?
You're gonna be wearing shoes anyway!

14
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:58,053
Mom!

15
00:01:58,529 --> 00:01:59,927
What? God! Hi.

16
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:02,898
- What are you doing?
- Having a heart attack.

17
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,230
I thought you were up. It's 7:10.

18
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:06,894
- What?
- It's 7:10.

19
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,958
No.

20
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,970
Stop it! It's 5:45.

21
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,974
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.

22
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,875
I set the clock for 5:45, so it's...

23
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,079
It's 7:10.

24
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,974
I can't be late on my first day of school.

25
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,780
You know what happens
when people are late on the first day?

26
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,876
It's shorter?

27
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:27,614
For the rest of the year
they're labeled "The late girl."

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,123
So dramatic. Where's the bathroom?

29
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,422
We have to go! What if there's traffic?

30
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:38,455
I had this all planned.
I was gonna get up early.

31
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,898
I was gonna get coffee.
I was gonna take a shower.

32
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:45,403
I was gonna pick up my clothes
from the dry cleaner's.

33
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:50,266
- Oh, my God. My clothes.
- What?

34
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:53,334
- I don't have any clean clothes.
- It's 7:15.

35
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,175
- All my nice things were dirty.
- It's 7:16.

36
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:58,807
I was gonna wear my blue suit
with the flippy skirt.

37
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,715
- I look so great in the flippy skirt.
- It's 7:17.

38
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,253
You know what, time lady?

39
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:07,154
Go downstairs and warm up the car.
That would be really super. Thank you.

40
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:08,623
Just hurry!

41
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,850
This sucks!

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,827
- It's 7:18.
- For the love of God!

43
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:18,425
This is the last time I buy anything
just because it's furry!

44
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:21,326
It's 7...

45
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:24,065
Don't even think
of finishing that sentence.

46
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,799
What?

47
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,137
Nothing. I just didn't know
the rodeo was in town.

48
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,302
That's it. I'm bringing the baby pictures.

49
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:34,075
No! I'm sorry.
I love the rodeo, the rodeo rules.

50
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:22,083
- I remember it being smaller.
- Yeah. And less...

51
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,450
- Off with their heads.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:28,621
What are you looking at?

53
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:32,530
I'm just trying to see if there's
a hunchback up in that bell tower.

54
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,693
So, how do I look?

55
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,326
You look great.

56
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:40,304
- Really?
- Really.

57
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:43,900
You are an amazing kid.
You have earned this.

58
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,801
You just go in there
and show them what smart really is.

59
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,610
I love you. Call me if you need me.

60
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,276
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

61
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,612
Call me if you need anything.
I'm great at making up dirty cheers.

62
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,920
- You have to go in with me.
- Rory, come on.

63
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,219
You have to meet the headmaster.

64
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:07,793
Look at me. I can't meet anybody
who does anything in there.

65
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,029
No! I look like that chick
from The Dukes of Hazzard.

66
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,931
This is my first day.

67
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:16,300
You are not getting out of
going in there with me. Period.

68
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,834
Good morning.

69
00:05:25,948 --> 00:05:28,075
We're gonna be best friends.

70
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:31,613
- So, where do we go?
- The Ambroise building.

71
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,047
- Which is?
- The big, scary one.

72
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:38,647
Great! Thanks for the input.

73
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,491
- Lost?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,927
We're looking for the headmaster's office,
Ambroise building.

75
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,292
Okay. This is it right here.

76
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,401
Just go inside, down the stairs,
make a left...

77
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,132
and the headmaster's office
is at the end of the hall.

78
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,400
- Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

79
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:59,005
I'm lan Jack.
My daughter Julia goes to school here.

80
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:02,910
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
This is my daughter, Rory.

81
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,274
- Your daughter? Really?
- Yep.

82
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,012
Wow, that's great.

83
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,914
I mean, daughters are a great thing.

84
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,852
- We're big fans.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,456
Is your husband here?
I'd love to meet him.

86
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,085
I'm not married.

87
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,151
I'd love to meet your wife.

88
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,857
- I'm divorced.
- Shame.

89
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:24,922
- Excuse me. I really got to...
- Right.

90
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,731
We gotta go meet the big guy,
and I gotta get back to work.

91
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,827
- Where do you work?
- At an inn.

92
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:33,466
- The Independence Inn. I run it.
- Really?

93
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:36,668
In a different outfit, of course.

94
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:40,242
It was nice to meet you, Lorelai.
Good luck in school, Rory.

95
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:43,110
- I'll tell Julia to look out for you.
- Great, thanks.

96
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,444
See you.

97
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,549
What a nice man.

98
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:51,948
You're feeling pretty good
about yourself right now, aren't you?

99
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,217
Yeah.

100
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,692
- Do you want me to get you a mirror?
- I'm back. Let's go.

101
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,030
Good. More big stuff.

102
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,430
- You ready?
- No.

103
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:41,892
- You ready?
- Yes.

104
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:52,668
Excuse me.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,712
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

106
00:07:56,782 --> 00:08:00,512
This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore,
because I named her after me.

107
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:04,042
I was in the hospital, all whacked out
on Demerol. Never mind.

108
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,621
But we call her Rory.
It's short for Lorelai...

109
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:11,059
but she'll answer to either one
or even "Hey, you" depending on...

110
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,028
Is the headmaster here?

111
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:14,562
One moment.

112
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,005
See, that's what happens
when you go to bed with your makeup on.

113
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,978
Headmaster Charleston will see you now.

114
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:33,808
Great. Thanks.

115
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,742
Ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.

116
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,412
Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet...

117
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,713
Mom.

118
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,325
What are you doing here?

119
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,851
I came to wish my granddaughter luck
on her first day of school.

120
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,558
Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform.

121
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,100
You didn't have to come all the way
out here, Mom.

122
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,002
This gave me a chance to make sure
that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.

123
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,370
- You're Hanlin.
- Hanlin Charleston.

124
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,933
Hanlin's wife and I are on the Symphony
Fundraising Committee together.

125
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,410
Wow. That's great.

126
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,275
Your father and I are golf rivals.

127
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:13,009
We're still fighting it out
to see which one is worse.

128
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,074
Oh, yes. We're all old friends.

129
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,313
Well, there's nothing like friends.

130
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,288
Especially if they're old... ones.

131
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:24,382
Would you like to take off your coat
and have a seat?

132
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,325
No, I'm fine.

133
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:29,454
They were a little overzealous
with the furnace this morning.

134
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:32,193
- It's quite warm in here.
- I like it warm.

135
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,099
Take off your coat and sit down.

136
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,694
You don't want Hanlin
to think you're rude.

137
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,180
Laundry day.

138
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:56,484
Hanlin, did you know
that Rory has a 4.0 grade average?

139
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:58,088
I'm sure he does, Mom.

140
00:09:58,157 --> 00:10:00,853
This is a very special girl.
You take good care of her.

141
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,393
We'll do our best, Emily.

142
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,622
Oh, God. Rory's not going to be a problem.

143
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,687
She's totally low maintenance.
You know, like a Honda.

144
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:10,063
You know, they're just easy...

145
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,803
Nice office.

146
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,862
I don't think we should take up
any more of your precious time.

147
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,033
Hanlin, it was lovely to see you.
Give Bitty our love.

148
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,510
Tell Richard I'll see him
at the club Sunday.

149
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,638
Have a wonderful day, Rory.
I want to hear all about it.

150
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:28,705
Do you need a ride,
or is your horse parked outside?

151
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,376
It's so nice to meet you.

152
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:34,547
Have a great day.

153
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,348
You don't want to forget your coat.

154
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,453
No, 'cause that would be embarrassing.

155
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,691
How do you leave the house
looking like that?

156
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,237
It was not planned, believe me.

157
00:10:51,304 --> 00:10:52,771
And on Rory's first day of school.

158
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,068
What kind of impression
did you think you'd make?

159
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,334
What are you doing here?

160
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,774
I told you,
I came to put in a good word for Rory.

161
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,971
- She didn't need a good word.
- I'm not allowed here, is that it?

162
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,206
I didn't say that.

163
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:05,876
I'm allowed to pay,
but I can't set foot on the premises.

164
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,111
- I want to get the rules straight.
- Oh, boy.

165
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:10,711
- How about driving down the street?
- Forget it.

166
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,222
Maybe I should avoid
this neighborhood altogether.

167
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,087
Though my doctor is down the block.

168
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,060
Maybe I'll get special permission
if I'm bleeding from the head.

169
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm sorry.
I was just surprised to see you here.

170
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:25,861
I thought it was important for this school
to know they had a Gilmore with them.

171
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,300
A very good thought.

172
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,702
And that some of the Gilmores
actually own clothing.

173
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,866
And on that note, I have to get to work.
I'll see you later.

174
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,636
Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,513
You're obviously a bright girl,
Miss Gilmore.

176
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,710
- Thank you.
- Good grades, the teachers like you.

177
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:48,482
Not a lot of social activities, though.

178
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,053
Just living at Stars Hollow
is a social activity, actually.

179
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:54,059
Nothing in your school appealed to you?

180
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,890
I work at my mother's inn
after school sometimes.

181
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:00,489
I was in the German Club for a while.
But there were only three of us.

182
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:04,297
Then two left for the French Club
after seeing Schindler's List.

183
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,303
What are your aspirations?

184
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,636
I want to go to Harvard
to study Journalism and Political Science.

185
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,540
- On your way to being...
- Christiane Amanpour.

186
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,077
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,636
- Not Cokie Roberts?
- No.

188
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:20,410
Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women
from The View?

189
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:22,040
No.

190
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,948
Why do you wish
to be Christiane Amanpour?

191
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,319
I don't wish to be her exactly.

192
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,983
- I just want to do what she does.
- Which is?

193
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,089
Travel, see the world up close...

194
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:37,961
report on what's really going on,
be part of something big.

195
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,127
And to be a part of something big
you have to be on TV?

196
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:43,227
Why not lead the police
on a high-speed chase?

197
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,168
That's a quicker way to achieve this goal.

198
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,104
Being on TV has nothing to do with it.

199
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:51,201
Maybe I'll be a journalist and write books
or articles about what I see.

200
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:55,037
I just want to be sure
that I see... something.

201
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:02,283
You'll notice the debating team's
also missing from my resume.

202
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:07,090
I've known your grandparents
for quite some time.

203
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,352
I know.

204
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:11,862
In fact, I was at a party
at their house just last week...

205
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:15,262
where I had the most delicious
lobster puffs I've ever eaten.

206
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,364
I'm very fond of them.

207
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,133
That's nice.

208
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:22,500
None of this, however,
will be of any benefit to you.

209
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,939
Chilton has one of
the highest academic standards...

210
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,738
of any school in America.

211
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,278
You may have been the smartest girl
at Stars Hollow...

212
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,937
but this is a different place.

213
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,311
Pressures are greater,
the rules are stricter...

214
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,317
and the expectations are higher.

215
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,511
If you make it through...

216
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,486
you'll have received
one of the finest educations one can get.

217
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:43,011
And there should be no reason
why you should not achieve all your goals.

218
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,818
However, since you are starting late...

219
00:13:44,893 --> 00:13:47,452
and are not used
to this highly competitive atmosphere...

220
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,961
there is a good chance you will fail.

221
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,998
That is fine. Failure is a part of life.

222
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,926
But not a part of Chilton.

223
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,002
Understand?

224
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,699
So, you liked the lobster puffs?

225
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,813
Take this to Miss James
in the administration office across the hall.

226
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:30,128
Hi, I'm looking for Miss James.

227
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,093
- Name?
- Lorelai Gilmore.

228
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,933
- But I go by Rory.
- Fill this out, please.

229
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:51,811
- Well?
- Shut up.

230
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,317
Hurry please. Spiders.

231
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:55,514
- Lorelai Gilmore.
- Nice stripper name.

232
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,955
- Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.
- Where's that?

233
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,890
Drive west, make a left at the haystacks,
and follow the cows.

234
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,290
A Dixie chick.

235
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,387
Perfect attendance,
4.0 grade point average.

236
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:05,623
Bugs, dirt, twigs.

237
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,959
She's a Journalism major.

238
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,296
That means she's going out
for the school paper.

239
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,734
Not necessarily.

240
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,770
She's got a thousand recommendations
in here.

241
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,362
Popular with the adults.
Going out for the school paper.

242
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,236
Will you stop? You don't know that.

243
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,570
- Something's biting me.
- Quiet.

244
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:19,630
I hate nature.

245
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,609
She'll never catch up.
She's a month behind.

246
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,273
- You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.
- You're funny.

247
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,939
Okay, lizard, goodbye.

248
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,417
Why are they letting
these extra people in?

249
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,612
They just take up space
and screw up the curve.

250
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,587
We don't need any new kids here.

251
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:33,916
Too late.

252
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:39,354
Here's the dining room, the science hall,
and the theater.

253
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:42,454
Here's your locker number,
here's your schedule, take this map.

254
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,498
Here's the rules of the school
and the Chilton Honor Code.

255
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:49,058
Here are the words to the school song
which must be recited upon demand.

256
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,071
This can happen any place, any time.

257
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,938
If you do it in Latin, you get extra credit.
Do you have any questions?

258
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,569
- Not at the moment.
- Lf you do, make an appointment...

259
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:59,578
to see your guidance counselor,
Mr. Winters.

260
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:01,943
He handles everything
but bulimia and pregnancy.

261
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:05,346
For that, you have to go to the nurse
or Coach Rubens.

262
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:07,146
Welcome to Chilton.

263
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:19,218
I already had the longest day of my life,
and it's only 10:00. How nice.

264
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:20,889
- There's no coffee.
- That's not funny.

265
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,226
I can give you herbal tea.

266
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,132
This is not an herbal tea morning.
This is a coffee morning.

267
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,294
Every morning for you is a coffee morning.

268
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,134
This is a jumbo coffee morning.
I need coffee in an I.V.

269
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,901
I can give you tea and a Balance Bar.

270
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,999
Please, please tell me you're kidding.

271
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,068
- I'm kidding.
- You're sick.

272
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,772
- Yep.
- You're a sadist. You're a fiend!

273
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:39,869
You're pretty.

274
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:41,677
- For here or to go?
- To go please.

275
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,242
Want to know what this does
to your nervous system?

276
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,253
- Do you have a chart? I love charts.
- Forget it, kill yourself.

277
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:50,223
So, what happened this morning
that was so awful?

278
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,753
- Rory started Chilton.
- Really?

279
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,151
Yeah.

280
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,284
What?

281
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:59,457
That's how you dressed to go to Chilton?
That's a fancy school.

282
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:03,468
My clothes were at the cleaners,
and my fuzzy clock didn't purr on time.

283
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,299
- It didn't purr?
- It's fuzzy. It purrs.

284
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:08,498
You know what. Never mind. I gotta go.

285
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:12,408
- I had a plan, damn it.
- Me, too. Next time you're getting tea.

286
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,741
Visualize, ladies.

287
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,945
It's a Thanksgiving Day parade.

288
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,681
You're standing on Fifth Avenue.

289
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:28,657
There's 100 beautiful boys
marching in place behind you.

290
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,023
And there you are.

291
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:34,496
You are in front with your fabulous legs
and your perfect tush.

292
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:38,294
Your baton is on fire,
and the crowd goes nuts!

293
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,662
Okay, cookie time.

294
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:44,272
- Lorelai, hi.
- Hey, Patty.

295
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,699
Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton?

296
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,572
Yeah, she's there now.
I just got through dropping her off.

297
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,043
Is that what you wore?

298
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,774
- Look at the time. See you, Patty.
- Bye.

299
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:58,143
Ladies, what do I see? Naked girls.

300
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:02,120
No, no, keep those leotards on.
This is not Brazil.

301
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,086
- Hello?
- Lorelai?

302
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,652
Mom?

303
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,163
Lorelai, good. I'm going shopping
this afternoon.

304
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:53,200
I thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory.

305
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:56,566
- Like what?
- A couple of skirts and tops for school.

306
00:18:56,737 --> 00:19:00,763
I already took care of all that, Mom.
I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops.

307
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,672
But there are five days in a school week.

308
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,576
Really? Because my days-of-the-week
underwear only go to Thursday.

309
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,841
- Is that a joke?
- Mom, two skirts are fine.

310
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,541
- I never know with you.
- Really, don't bother.

311
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,243
What if she gets one dirty?

312
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,287
- She'll wear the other one.
- What if she gets them both dirty?

313
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,948
We'll use this newfangled thing
called a washing machine.

314
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:21,514
The town chipped in and bought one.
My turn's Tuesday.

315
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,960
Then, what about socks?
Chilton has these special logo socks.

316
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:26,757
- Rory should have them.
- Mom, please.

317
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,197
What about the school sweater?
She might like that.

318
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,427
There's a sweater vest and a book bag.

319
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,332
Are you getting a cut
of the merchandising?

320
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:36,065
Rory should have these.
She'll be the only one who doesn't.

321
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:37,605
She'll live.

322
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,403
I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat.
Is she a size 6?

323
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,068
Mom, please.

324
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,372
This is a simple question, Lorelai.

325
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:47,648
She's a 6,
but I'd get an 8 in case she grows.

326
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,342
If she grows, I'll buy another.

327
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:52,408
Okay, then a 6 is great.
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

328
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:57,589
While French culture was the dominant
outside cultural influence...

329
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,785
especially for Russia's moneyed class...

330
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,158
English culture also had its impact.

331
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,719
Tolstoy's favorite author,
for instance, was...

332
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:05,786
Dickens.

333
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:10,392
Yes. And of course, last week we covered
Dostoyevsky's main authorial influences...

334
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,634
- George Sand and Balzac.
- Good.

335
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:17,601
As Tolstoy commenced writing
War and Peace and Anna Karenina...

336
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:20,407
- Count Leo would turn to...
- David Copperfield.

337
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,778
Correct. He would turn
to David Copperfield for inspiration.

338
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,341
- Mr. Dugray.
- Sir.

339
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,277
Nice to have you back.

340
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,877
- I hope your grandfather's better.
- Much better, sir.

341
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,889
Good. Take your seat, please.

342
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:38,993
Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities,
Little Dorrit...

343
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:42,457
all major influences on Leo Tolstoy.

344
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,189
Tomorrow...

345
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,131
- Who's that?
- New girl.

346
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:50,034
...writing styles of these
two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens.

347
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,497
Class dismissed.

348
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,300
Looks like we got ourselves a Mary.

349
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,009
Miss Gilmore, come up here, please.

350
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,408
Here are last week's study materials.

351
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:08,249
There'll be a test on them tomorrow.
But since you're new...

352
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:11,416
you can take a makeup on Monday.
Will that be sufficient time?

353
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,650
Monday? Sure, that's fine.

354
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:15,550
Good. That's just an overview.

355
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:18,461
It'd be helpful to borrow
another student's personal notes.

356
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:20,497
They tend to be more detailed.

357
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,661
More detailed than this?

358
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,793
It seems daunting right now, I know.

359
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,667
No. It's okay. It'll be fine.

360
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:31,307
Remember to get those notes.
They'll be a lifesaver.

361
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:34,970
I'm Paris.

362
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,171
I didn't see you there.
Where'd you come from?

363
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,770
I know who you are, too.

364
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,181
Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow.

365
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:42,649
You can call me Rory.

366
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,948
- Are you going out for The Franklin?
- The what?

367
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,147
Nice innocent act.

368
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,552
At least I know
you're not going out for Drama Club.

369
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:49,783
I'm confused.

370
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,089
The Franklin, the school paper,
are you going out for it?

371
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,253
I don't know. I have to find my locker first.

372
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,298
- I'm gonna be editor next year.
- Good for you.

373
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,628
I'm also the top of the class.

374
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,168
I intend to be valedictorian
when I graduate.

375
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,726
Okay. I'm going now.

376
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:06,236
You'll never catch up.
You'll never beat me.

377
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,401
This school is my domain,
and The Franklin is my domain.

378
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:11,568
Don't you ever forget that.

379
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:17,813
I guess you're not
going to let me borrow your notes.

380
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,549
They're smaller than the last batch.

381
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,218
No, they're not.

382
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,958
Smaller means watery.
No good peach taste.

383
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,792
No, there's plenty of peach taste...

384
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:37,390
being as they're, you know, peaches.

385
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:40,631
- What about the ones on the bottom?
- Great.

386
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:43,797
No. Be sure to check them all. That's it.

387
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:46,397
Give every last one of them
a nice, good squeeze.

388
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:49,842
You wouldn't want to leave me one
that I could sell to somebody else.

389
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,073
Wait a minute, you missed one.
I won't tell you which one it is.

390
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:57,278
I'm just going to let your impeccably
good radar... There it is, you got it.

391
00:22:57,352 --> 00:22:58,410
Okay.

392
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,552
- I look great, right?
- Yes.

393
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:04,284
Yes, see. This is how I was supposed
to look this morning.

394
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:07,224
- Morning, Jackson.
- Oh, my God, today was Rory's first day.

395
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:09,557
Yes. I was supposed
to look together and fabulous.

396
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,494
Not like I was playing quarters all night.

397
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,964
- Nobody cares how you looked.
- Everybody cared.

398
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:16,627
- Who?
- The other moms, the headmaster.

399
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:20,865
My mom, Luke, Miss Patty,
the new fire chief with the tiny little head.

400
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,736
Taste this.

401
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:25,741
A little watery.

402
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:27,506
Now, you planned this.

403
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:30,309
- Did you say something about your mom?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:33,248
I walked into the headmaster's office,
and there she was.

405
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,341
Really? Why?

406
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:38,218
Because she knew I'd wake up late,
dress like a cowgirl, and humiliate myself.

407
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,655
- Wow, she's good.
- She's the best.

408
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,248
I would love to know what you're doing.

409
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:46,260
- They're rolling differently, too.
- Because of the extra water.

410
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,559
- Exactly.
- Makes perfect sense.

411
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,454
I would ignore those women...

412
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:54,195
because the only thing that matters
is that Rory got into that great school.

413
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:58,261
I know. She looked so amazing
in her uniform, and she was so excited.

414
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,605
I just admire her so much,
jumping into a new school.

415
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,400
- She's my hero.
- Mine, too.

416
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,001
Yeah. Sign me up.

417
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,206
Sookie, the peaches, please.

418
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,576
Excuse me. There's a phone call for you...

419
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:15,416
and if I'm to fetch you like a dog,
I'd like a cookie and a raise.

420
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,285
Thanks for the peach.

421
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,922
This will be absolutely wonderful.

422
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,225
There are supposed to be darling shops
all up and down this street.

423
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,165
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me
where we can find the best antiques?

424
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,202
At your house, I'd guess.

425
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,567
Mom, did I give you this number,
'cause I don't remember doing that.

426
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,303
Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind.
What can I...

427
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,844
I'm sorry, Mom,
can you hold on one second?

428
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:45,074
Drella, could you take it down
just a notch?

429
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,641
Thanks. Okay, I'm back.

430
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:51,547
I wanted you to know that I just bought
a parking space for Rory at Chilton.

431
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:54,278
- You what?
- They are very hard to come by.

432
00:24:54,357 --> 00:24:58,052
- But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers.
- Mom, Rory doesn't have a car.

433
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:00,060
No, but she's got a birthday
coming up soon.

434
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,029
Okay, hold on a second.

435
00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:06,459
Drella, please, a little softer.

436
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:09,502
Do I look like I got Panasonic
stamped on my ass?

437
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:13,030
Mom, you are not buying Rory a car.

438
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:15,370
Why not? She's a smart girl.
She's responsible.

439
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:18,343
- She doesn't need one.
- She needs to have a way to get around.

440
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,379
- To get to school.
- She'll be taking the bus.

441
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,242
I know. I hate that she takes the bus.

442
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:23,713
Drug dealers take the bus.

443
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,443
You know what, Mom? I gotta go.

444
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:27,879
Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date.

445
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:29,249
Okay. Bye.

446
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:37,451
Mary.

447
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:40,529
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

448
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:43,029
- My name is Rory.
- I'm Tristan.

449
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,760
- Hi.
- So you new?

450
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,936
- Yeah, first day.
- Remmy's class is rough.

451
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,931
Yeah, it seemed very intense.

452
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,497
I could loan you my notes,
if that would help.

453
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:54,873
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah?

454
00:25:56,145 --> 00:25:57,475
How great?

455
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,278
I don't know.

456
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:02,009
Mr. Remmy said that
getting someone's notes would be...

457
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:04,814
I could even help you study if you want.

458
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,280
I kind of view studying
as a solitary activity.

459
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:11,088
But thanks.

460
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,556
Bye, Mary.

461
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,258
It's Rory.

462
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:23,396
- I completely understand.
- Do you? Because this is a brand-new car.

463
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,062
- But I swear.
- He brings the car up and it's scratched.

464
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,468
I just backed the car up and...

465
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,702
I'd know if my car was scratched
before I parked it or not.

466
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:32,332
Let's calm down.

467
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,071
Sir, why don't I have your car
looked at tomorrow?

468
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:38,114
- I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this.
- No.

469
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:42,016
In the meantime, I would love for you
to have lunch here on me.

470
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,449
Dessert is a must.

471
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,386
Anything with our homemade ice cream
is absolutely delicious.

472
00:26:46,457 --> 00:26:50,358
I promise, life as you know it,
will never be the same. What do you say?

473
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:52,851
I think I will.

474
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:54,827
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

475
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:58,657
- Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car.
- Derek.

476
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:01,760
I mean, if you thought I was unreliable
or a bad driver...

477
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,098
It's okay.

478
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:05,331
'Cause I can drive.

479
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,636
Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can.

480
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,835
We'll take it to Musky's tomorrow
and have the guys look at it.

481
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:13,708
I'm sure they can buff it out
for nothing. Okay?

482
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:14,935
Okay.

483
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,682
That's a real nice outfit
you're wearing today.

484
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,379
Thank you, Derek.

485
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,151
Once again, your faithful pooch
is here to say:

486
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,854
"Please come to the desk.
Someone needs to talk to you."

487
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:32,396
- It's not my mother, is it?
- It's possible.

488
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,230
- It's possible?
- There's a resemblance.

489
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:38,832
- Hi.
- Hi. Is this a bad time?

490
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,269
No, not at all. What are you doing here?

491
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,501
I had to meet an associate for lunch.
He was coming from New York.

492
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:47,167
So I thought,
"Why not meet him in a beautiful inn?"

493
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,611
- Good. Enjoy your lunch.
- Thanks. I will.

494
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,079
- Okay.
- And I was also wondering...

495
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:54,616
if maybe I could take you out
to dinner sometime.

496
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,117
We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we?

497
00:27:57,187 --> 00:28:00,245
It's the company more than the food
that interests me.

498
00:28:00,523 --> 00:28:02,513
- I'm flattered.
- Is that a yes?

499
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,884
That's a... you're a dad.

500
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,488
And you're a mom.

501
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,928
Although I'm still finding that
really hard to believe.

502
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:12,397
No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad.

503
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,028
- That sounds bad.
- Not bad. Just tricky.

504
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,134
You know, Rory just started there...

505
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:20,638
and I should let her fall in
with the bad crowd...

506
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,766
before I start hooking up with the PTA.

507
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,036
I'm not on the PTA.

508
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,976
See? There you go,
I can't date anyone not on the PTA.

509
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:29,640
- It's just a casual dinner.
- Sorry.

510
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:37,818
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to China for a week on business.

511
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,118
When I get back, I'm going to try again.

512
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:41,886
China? Wow.

513
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:43,916
- Impressed?
- No.

514
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:47,761
Rome, I'd be impressed.
China, I'm just, "China? Wow."

515
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:54,166
"Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager."
I'll talk to you soon.

516
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,629
- Have a safe trip.
- I will.

517
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:05,510
- He does that so well.
- You are making me sick.

518
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,308
Now, honey. You try it.
I'll watch you walk away, too.

519
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,408
- Stop it.
- Go on now, walk.

520
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:14,113
- It can't be that bad.
- Leave me alone.

521
00:29:14,454 --> 00:29:16,979
No. You have to do it
with a little more attitude.

522
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:19,082
Make me think you mean it.

523
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,871
That's lunch.

524
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,519
I'm sorry, but you're going to open.

525
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:06,300
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

526
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,495
Paris, please, I'm so sorry.

527
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,470
It was an accident.
My locker, it just slipped.

528
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:14,133
I pulled too hard. I didn't mean to...

529
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,800
Is there water in that moat?

530
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:18,503
Get away from me.

531
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,881
Excuse me, I need Ms. Ness. History?

532
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,546
It's behind you.

533
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:32,648
Of course it is.

534
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,388
You've got to be kidding me.

535
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,862
Seats now, please.

536
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:46,767
Hey, Mary.

537
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:49,696
Okay.

538
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,768
We left our projects off on Friday
with Mr. Gaynor...

539
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,311
so today we will pick up with Miss Geller.

540
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,447
I don't have my project.

541
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:03,815
Miss Geller, did you have sufficient time
to complete your project?

542
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:06,480
- Yes.
- And yet you don't have it done?

543
00:31:06,622 --> 00:31:08,316
- No.
- All right.

544
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,822
You will receive an "incomplete"
for this project.

545
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,791
- It's my fault.
- Who are you?

546
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:15,658
- Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project.
- Shut up.

547
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,860
I don't have a Rory Gilmore.
I have a Lorelai Gilmore.

548
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:21,024
That's me.

549
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,568
You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore?

550
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:26,362
Yes. And I wrecked her project.
My locker got stuck.

551
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,997
Just stay out of this.

552
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:30,805
- Do you go by Rory or Lorelai?
- Whatever.

553
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:32,605
It's not her fault.

554
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,938
- I need you to pick one.
- One what?

555
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:36,276
One name.

556
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:38,373
- Rory.
- Fine. Thank you.

557
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,752
You wrecked Paris' project when?

558
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:45,345
- Just before class.
- Very convenient.

559
00:31:45,422 --> 00:31:48,482
No, I did. My locker got stuck,
and when I opened it...

560
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,583
Stop it!

561
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,287
Miss Gilmore, since you say
you wrecked her project...

562
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,455
then you may help her fix it.

563
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:56,498
You have until tomorrow.

564
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,895
- Fine.
- No.

565
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,963
- Why not?
- I don't want your help.

566
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,402
- But I don't mind doing it.
- Stay out of this.

567
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,802
What's wrong with you?

568
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:05,363
- I'm trying to help.
- Don't.

569
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,203
Ladies, enough.

570
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:11,705
If you don't want Miss Gilmore's help,
then you may have until tomorrow.

571
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:14,612
If it's not done,
you will receive an "incomplete."

572
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,410
Is that understood?

573
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:18,876
Yes.

574
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,280
As long as you're standing, class...

575
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:26,718
we have a new student.
Say hello to Rory Gilmore.

576
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:28,852
Hello, Mary.

577
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:40,066
Now, walk smooth.
That's the new Harry Potter on your heads.

578
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:43,595
If they should drop, Harry will die,
and there won't be any more books.

579
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:46,872
Now that's how you should've dressed
this morning, missy.

580
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:52,849
What are you doing here?

581
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:57,146
See now, that's why you were voted
Mr. Personality of the new millennium.

582
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,550
Where's your crown?

583
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:01,089
I just mean you don't usually come in
at this time.

584
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:03,625
I have to pick up Rory from school.

585
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,384
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

586
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,791
No lectures?

587
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:10,396
My blood sugar's low.
I'll eat an apple and get back to you.

588
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,523
God, this has been one hectic,
bizarre day for me.

589
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,694
Yeah?

590
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,796
This morning with the being late
and my mom with her existing.

591
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,773
And this father from Chilton.

592
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:24,743
He drove out to the Inn all the way
from Hartford just to ask me out.

593
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:26,737
Really? Are you going?

594
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:31,444
No. He's got a kid in school with Rory,
and the whole thing seemed a little weird.

595
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,909
- Good.
- Good?

596
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:38,216
Yeah, I think it's good
that you turned him down.

597
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:39,614
Okay.

598
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,122
- I mean, he's probably old, right?
- Old?

599
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:45,162
- Yeah, I mean, he has a kid in high school.
- Well, so do I.

600
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,198
You were young when you had Rory.
Most people aren't that young.

601
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,097
- Most people are...
- Old.

602
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,156
Yeah.

603
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:53,566
Like this guy who asked me out.

604
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:56,500
But you're not going.

605
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:59,335
No, I'm not going.

606
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:06,171
Oh, that's me.

607
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:11,276
Hello? Hi, Babbette.

608
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:14,980
What? Okay.

609
00:34:15,656 --> 00:34:17,988
No, I'll be right there. Thanks.

610
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,959
I have to go.

611
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:23,620
Keep it. I gave you decaf.

612
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:41,368
Lorelai, I'm so sorry
I had to call you like this.

613
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,573
That's okay, Babbette. I appreciate it.

614
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:47,447
All of a sudden, they pull up, get out
of the truck, and start sniffing around.

615
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,919
- It's very strange.
- All right. Let me talk to them.

616
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,114
- Tell her about the gnome.
- They kicked a gnome.

617
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,521
- What?
- Right in the head.

618
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,718
- That's just not cool.
- I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?

619
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,954
He's fine, sugar. Thanks for asking.

620
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,722
But I wouldn't trust these boys.

621
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,766
Gnome kicking says a lot
about a man's character.

622
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:06,734
Yes. I'm gonna go
take care of this. Thanks.

623
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:13,767
What are you doing?

624
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:15,241
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

625
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:18,677
I'm supposed to install a DSL
for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?

626
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,214
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm Mick.

627
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:22,476
Nice to meet you.
Could you get off my porch?

628
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,643
I was told to look for a ceramic frog
with a key in it.

629
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,914
- I don't understand.
- We can't find the frog.

630
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:32,047
- I didn't order a DSL.
- The order was placed by Emily Gilmore.

631
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,647
No.

632
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:36,785
We would've been done,
but the frog search put us way behind.

633
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:37,955
Look.

634
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,389
- I found it.
- You found the frog.

635
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,094
- It was a turtle, not a frog.
- It says here it's a frog.

636
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:44,466
- It's a turtle.
- Really?

637
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:47,937
Trust me. Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel that DSL order.

638
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,437
Sure? It's already paid for.

639
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:51,874
Yeah, I know, but we don't need a DSL...

640
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:54,707
so thanks for coming,
and you guys can just go.

641
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:57,944
Is there a problem?

642
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:01,471
Nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn
into a really good play.

643
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:05,980
Let's try another passage.

644
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,083
"The Romanists have,
with great adroitness..."

645
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,559
"drawn three walls round themselves..."

646
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,959
"with which they have hitherto
protected themselves..."

647
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:20,758
"so that no one could reform them,
whereby Christendom has fallen terribly."

648
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,699
- Who said this?
- Martin Luther.

649
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:27,107
Very good, Miss Gilmore.

650
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:30,542
And what year did Martin Luther
address the Christian nobility?

651
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:33,079
- 1520.
- Very good, Miss Gilmore.

652
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,347
Until next time, class.

653
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:44,444
Stay out of my way.

654
00:36:44,524 --> 00:36:47,583
I will make this school a living hell for you.

655
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:52,028
See you tomorrow, Mary.

656
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,856
The name is Rory.

657
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,273
- Can I help you?
- God, I wish.

658
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,005
What on earth...

659
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:16,280
- You're not buying us a DSL.
- Lorelai, this is hardly the place.

660
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:18,546
I canceled the order,
and it's not happening.

661
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,644
But Rory needs the Internet for her school.

662
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:21,949
We have the Internet.

663
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:24,719
- This is faster.
- We like our Internet slow, okay?

664
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:28,056
We can turn it on, walk around,
do a little dance, make a sandwich.

665
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:31,256
With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking,
and we'd starve.

666
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,061
It'd be all work and no play.
Haven't you seen The Shining?

667
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,726
What on earth are you talking about?

668
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:38,235
Also, there will be no cars,
no parking spaces.

669
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:41,206
And all the uniforms
will be supplied by me. The mother.

670
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,264
That's final. There will be no discussion.

671
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:46,799
- You're being stubborn as usual.
- No, I'm not being stubborn as usual.

672
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,038
I'm being me.

673
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:51,207
The same person who always needed
to work out her own problems...

674
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:54,115
and take care of herself,
because that's the way I was born.

675
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,948
- That's how I am!
- Florence, I'm dripping.

676
00:37:57,355 --> 00:38:00,791
I appreciate what you have done for Rory
in paying for her school.

677
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:03,484
That will not be forgotten. You won't let it.

678
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:05,788
But she is my daughter.

679
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:08,660
And I decide how we live, not you.

680
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,233
Now then...

681
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:17,466
do they validate parking here?

682
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:20,100
There's a stamp at the desk.

683
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:22,974
Thank you.

684
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,221
Hey, you.

685
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:48,530
So, this whole plaid-skirt thing, my idea?

686
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,528
My day sucked, too.

687
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:52,866
- Promise?
- I swear on my mother's life.

688
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:55,263
- Not yet.
- Still hugging.

689
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,408
- So, I brought us some coffee.
- Why, I'm shocked.

690
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,103
Triple caps, easy foam.

691
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:04,443
If that doesn't work,
we'll stick our fingers in a light socket.

692
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:05,845
Come here.

693
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:10,808
Wow, what, do they expect you
to get smart all in one day?

694
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:13,719
- They expect a lot of things.
- So, tell me.

695
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:17,089
I don't know. It was just one big, long...

696
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:20,453
scary, tweedy, bad eight hours.

697
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:23,324
Add some hair spray,
and you've got my day.

698
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:26,560
One of the girls already hates me.
The guys are weird.

699
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:29,500
- Weirder than other guys?
- Yeah, they kept calling me Mary.

700
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,764
You're kidding me.

701
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:34,103
Wow, I can't believe they still say that.

702
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:37,965
- Why? What does it mean?
- Mary, like Virgin Mary.

703
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,411
It means they think
you look like a goody-goody.

704
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,141
- You're kidding.
- No.

705
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:45,580
What would they have called me
if they thought I looked like a slut?

706
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,982
They might have added a Magdalene to it.

707
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,510
Biblical insults.
This is an advanced school.

708
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,958
It was so weird
not having you in school today.

709
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,463
I mean, I finally noticed
some of the other kids.

710
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,966
Let me just say, they are a sad lot.

711
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,970
Yeah? Add a couple plaid skirts,
and you've got the Chilton freaks.

712
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,598
- I totally miss you.
- I miss you.

713
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,266
Guys, I have an idea.

714
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,208
What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays...

715
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:18,304
when I go to Hartford
for my business class...

716
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:21,214
what if Lane comes along,
and you guys can shop and study...

717
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,011
and join a cult and shave your heads?

718
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:26,144
- Really?
- All except the shaving your heads part.

719
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,519
Oh, no. What time is it?

720
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:30,649
6:30.

721
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:32,750
- I'm late for dinner.
- Again?

722
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:36,922
Lane, your mother is gonna kill me
if I keep sending you home fed and happy.

723
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:40,522
I'm sorry. But she found a website
that sells tofu in bulk.

724
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,897
You're kidding, right?

725
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:44,528
Yesterday, she went out
and bought a bigger fridge.

726
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:46,628
Boy, honey, your life is scary.

727
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:49,196
- Can I have your crust?
- It's the least I can do.

728
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:50,672
Thanks. Bye.

729
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,344
A pizza for your thoughts.

730
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,652
I wish I could figure out a way
to get Paris off my back.

731
00:41:07,724 --> 00:41:10,124
Yeah, angry chicks are the worst.

732
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:13,389
When I was in high school, I had a Paris.

733
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,589
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she was horrible.

734
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:18,997
- How'd you get rid of her?
- I got pregnant and dropped out.

735
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:22,161
- What if I learn to French braid her hair?
- Even better.

736
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:25,295
Sweetie, you can't let those kids
get you down.

737
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:26,532
I know.

738
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:28,439
Do you want me to talk to anybody?

739
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,342
A parent, a teacher,
a big guy named Moose?

740
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:34,303
- I'll just figure it out for myself.
- Okay.

741
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:38,209
What?

742
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:40,752
I was thinking
about the way Paris' face looked...

743
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,152
when I beat her
to that Martin Luther question.

744
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:45,349
- Good?
- Fourteen shades of purple.

745
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:47,950
- Cool.
- Tomorrow I'm shooting for 15.

746
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:51,862
What do you think of Luke?

747
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:55,093
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do you think he's cute?

748
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,134
- No. No way.
- No way, what?

749
00:41:58,202 --> 00:42:01,103
- You cannot date Luke.
- I said nothing about dating Luke.

750
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:04,801
If you date him, you'll break up
and we'll never be able to eat there again.

751
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,537
I repeat, I said nothing about dating Luke.

752
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:10,672
Date Al from Pancake World,
his food stinks.

753
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,578
I cannot believe what I'm hearing.

754
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,550
Al's food does not stink, Al stinks.
