1
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:14,886
Okay, Ross.

2
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,563
l realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but. . . .

3
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:22,123
-Let me explain, okay?
-We weren't doing anything!

4
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:24,802
Rach, he just saw us.

5
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:31,363
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,043
-That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
-Dude, chill!

7
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,169
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados. . .

8
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,052
. . .but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened. . .

9
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:43,965
. . .was because l saw you kiss Charlie.

10
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:47,768
Yeah, you started it!
l have got to chill.

11
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:54,369
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

12
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,843
-But. . . .
-Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

13
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:01,130
Yeah. But it did happen.

14
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,012
So. . . .

15
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:08,647
Ross?

16
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:18,287
Ross?

17
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:24,286
Can we just close the door?

18
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,329
The One Where Ross ls Fine

19
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:02,331
Ross, say something.

20
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:03,892
Anything.

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,370
So you two are. . .?

22
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:09,852
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,889
And have you had. . .?

24
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,971
-No. No, no, no.
-No. No.

25
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,368
But if l hadn't walked in here,
would you. . .?

26
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,404
Probably--
No. No.

27
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:25,532
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

28
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,564
You have every right
to go nuts.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,889
l'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

30
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:31,890
No, but you know what l mean.

31
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,642
lf you two are happy. . .

32
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:41,885
. . .then l'm happy for you.

33
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,763
l'm fine.

34
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,089
-Really?
-Absolutely.

35
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,528
l'm fine.

36
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:52,366
Totally fine.

37
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,843
l don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky. . .

38
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,891
. . .because, really, l'm fine.

39
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:07,131
l'm not saying l wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.

40
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,528
l mean, at first l was like:

41
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:16,052
But now that l've had time
to absorb it. . . .

42
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,846
Loving this.

43
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,891
-Ross--
-lt's all working out.

44
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:27,530
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

45
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,691
-You know what we should do?
-Calm ourselves?

46
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:32,687
No.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,885
We should all have dinner.

48
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,965
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
l'll cook!

49
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:40,802
Look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

50
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,804
Weird? What? What's weird?

51
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,124
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food. . .

52
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,249
. . .because l'm making fajitas!

53
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,570
l do like fajitas.

54
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,571
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

55
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,123
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

56
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:10,047
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

57
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:11,771
There's a hair in my coffee.

58
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:15,126
Hey, guys.

59
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,330
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

60
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,484
lt's funny,
every time you say " triplets" . . .

61
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,008
. . .l think of three hot,
blond 1 9-year-olds.

62
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,487
That's sweet.

63
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,570
Drink your hair.

64
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,766
Hey, what's all this stuff?

65
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,487
They're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

66
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:34,968
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

67
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,885
Get this one.

68
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,325
That's not really how it works.

69
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,172
-Oh, how does it work?
-l don't know!

70
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:46,206
lf you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends. . .

71
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:49,410
. . .Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. l'm sure they'd help you.

72
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,165
Thanks, that would be great.

73
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,483
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

74
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,852
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

75
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:02,891
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

76
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,962
That's not what we talked about!

77
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,529
-Hi, Frank.
-Hi.

78
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,490
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

79
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:14,008
-Hi, Frank.
-Hi. Hey, how you doing?

80
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,922
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

81
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,931
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr. . .

82
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,091
. . .pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

83
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:28,208
And that's Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

84
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,486
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

85
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:36,204
" Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

86
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,722
Can l just say, l know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cool.

87
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:46,363
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

88
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,609
Well, what would we be doing?

89
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:50,809
l'd take you out
for a romantic night.

90
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:55,848
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

91
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,372
Feel me up?

92
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:00,291
ln a carriage.

93
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:03,772
-Hey, Charlie!
-Hi.

94
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:05,651
-Hi.
-Hey.

95
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:07,007
So. . .

96
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,841
-. . .dreading this?
-Oh, you bet.

97
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,848
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?

98
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:16,483
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

99
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,283
Well, thanks.

100
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:21,882
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

101
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,689
Yeah, l didn't throw any of that out.

102
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:30,611
l thought l heard voices.

103
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,486
Hi, Charlie.

104
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,128
Hey, Joey.

105
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:40,287
And, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

106
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:46,005
l'm just kidding. l know Rachel.
l know. . . .

107
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,609
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

108
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:52,923
Okay.
Well, we brought you some wine.

109
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,564
That is so thoughtful.

110
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:58,843
She's a keeper.

111
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:02,926
-And what did you bring me, huh?
-Actually, that's--

112
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,044
Underwear, a toothbrush. . .

113
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,249
. . .and a Van Halen CD.

114
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:09,927
l can use all these things!

115
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,488
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little--

116
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:15,968
What? Fine? Because l am.

117
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,363
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't--?
You see?

118
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,569
Who else is fine?

119
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,447
Come on.

120
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:25,611
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

121
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,570
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

122
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,247
l'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

123
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,251
Oh, God.

124
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,125
So adorable.

125
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,126
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

126
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:45,888
Yeah, l really cherish
these moments. . .

127
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,443
. . .because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

128
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,803
Well, they may be a handful. . .

129
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,884
-. . .but they're so cute.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:58,568
Oh, God, last time l babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.

131
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,731
l haven't slept in four years.

132
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,643
That's a long time.

133
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:08,008
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

134
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:09,931
There's just so many of them.

135
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,685
You know, two l could handle.

136
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,287
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

137
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,684
What do l do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

138
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:20,572
l got no more hands
to protect my area.

139
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,603
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

140
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:24,802
Yeah, l know, Frank.

141
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:28,124
l counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

142
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,327
Sometimes, l think that--

143
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:36,926
Oh, no, no, no, l can't say it.
lt's too horrible. No.

144
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:39,647
What?

145
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,889
No, no, l can't.

146
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,441
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

147
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,650
Because l didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

148
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:53,004
Oh, no, l would never do that.
No. l just. . .

149
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,481
. . .was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

150
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,411
What?

151
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,728
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

152
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,012
Thank you so much for seeing us.

153
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:12,289
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

154
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,011
Please, we're happy to help.

155
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,682
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

156
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:20,812
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

157
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:29,092
l mean, you have a lovely home.

158
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:31,444
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

159
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,923
Well, actually,
l think this might help.

160
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,122
lt's pretty much. . .

161
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,363
-. . .all the information you need.
-Oh, my God.

162
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,252
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

163
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,132
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

164
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,368
Thank you.

165
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,769
l think l just had a tiny orgasm.

166
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,089
l know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

167
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:58,211
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

168
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,563
That's great. Can l see the book?

169
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,645
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

170
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:07,771
Please. lt's just so pretty and white.

171
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,928
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

172
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:13,611
l would have told him to do it too.

173
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,804
Can l adopt you?

174
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:20,083
-Hey, you must be Owen.
-Yeah.

175
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,648
l'm Chandler.
Hey, l was in the Scouts too.

176
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:26,323
-You were?
-ln fact, my father was a den mother.

177
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,845
You know how to use a compass?

178
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,487
l have a badge in it.

179
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,809
-You do? That's fantastic.
-You want to see it?

180
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,288
l'd love to, but l gotta get back
to your parents.

181
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,648
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

182
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:40,371
What?

183
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,651
What?

184
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:50,927
l'm adopted?

185
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,089
l got nothing.

186
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,685
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great. . .

187
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:07,169
. . .but this second batch is good.

188
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:12,010
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

189
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,443
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

190
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,808
You know, just the four of us.

191
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:18,725
Just hanging.

192
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,771
Dude, are you okay?

193
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,764
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

194
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:27,131
l'm fine, okay? l'm great.

195
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:30,126
l'm just--
l'm just proud of us.

196
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:33,603
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

197
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,724
No awareness.

198
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:39,646
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

199
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,410
Let's take a trip!

200
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:46,567
Okay, where do you think we can go?

201
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,849
My fajitas!

202
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:54,485
Look, Charlie,
l just want you to know. . .

203
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:58,726
. . .Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

204
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,083
You know, he normally
doesn't drink like this.

205
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,410
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

206
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,533
l'm sorry, have l made
this evening uncomfortable?

207
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:16,765
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

208
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,884
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

209
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,966
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

210
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,286
Okay, well, this is crazy.

211
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,849
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

212
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,526
Oh, no, of course we're not.

213
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,285
-That's insane.
-l know.

214
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:37,852
Alice would never go for it.

215
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:41,125
She's pretty tired too.
l think we could get her on board.

216
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:46,925
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically. . .

217
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:49,129
. . .which one
would you be willing to give up?

218
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,725
Frank Jr. Jr.?

219
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,163
You'd be getting a really good one.

220
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,927
l mean, you know,
he's really funny.

221
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,642
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

222
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:05,011
What's green and says,
"Hey, l'm a frog" ?

223
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,449
A talking frog.

224
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,650
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny.

225
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,206
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about Leslie?

226
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,449
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

227
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:23,162
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

228
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,091
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

229
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,365
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

230
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,972
l got big hopes for her.

231
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,728
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

232
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,962
Wow, Frank,
l think we just ran out of kids.

233
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,084
Oh, l think you're right.

234
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:51,404
Oh, wow. Phoebe, l don't think
l can give one of them up.

235
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:55,168
l mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

236
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:00,730
l'm sorry, Frank,
l didn't realize things were so bad.

237
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:04,010
You know, l'll help out more.
l can babysit anytime you want.

238
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,765
You name the day and l'll be there.

239
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,208
-How about tomorrow?
-Well, that's not good.

240
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:12,165
But l can move some stuff around
and l'll be there.

241
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,449
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

242
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,524
You'd do that for us?

243
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,883
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

244
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,968
Oh, look at them.

245
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,732
l love you so much.

246
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:34,285
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

247
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,085
-Where are Bill and Colleen?
-Kitchen, getting something to eat.

248
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,766
Can you believe
how nice they are?

249
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,161
We have to leave.

250
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,526
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

251
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:50,412
l didn't get to the bathroom.
l bumped into Owen on the way.

252
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,167
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance. . .

253
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,652
. . .l may have told him.

254
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,210
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, l can replace everything in there.

255
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,682
-Get that binder and let's go!
-Hi.

256
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,290
Some little snacks for everybody.

257
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:06,331
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

258
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,326
l'll go get him in a second.

259
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,730
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

260
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,489
But kids are so intuitive.

261
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,883
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

262
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:20,290
-l'm adopted?
-See? lntuitive.

263
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,724
What? Where did you hear that?

264
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,002
He told me.

265
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,963
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

266
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,047
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

267
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,762
You told him he's adopted?

268
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,527
l'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

269
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,730
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

270
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:46,249
" Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is real. "

271
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:48,125
He isn't?

272
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:51,528
We have to get out of here, baby.

273
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,843
Everyone, l would like
to make a toast. . .

274
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,806
. . .to Rachel and Joey.

275
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,651
And to love.

276
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,572
Ah, love!

277
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:13,768
L-O-V-E. Love.

278
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,969
L is for " life. "

279
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,601
And what is life without love?

280
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:22,087
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

281
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,650
O is for:

282
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,643
" Oh, wow! "

283
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:35,889
The V is for this. . .

284
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:39,887
. . .very surprising turn of events. . .

285
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,609
. . .which l am still fine with,
by the way.

286
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,324
E. . .

287
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,731
. . .is for how. . .

288
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:55,681
. . .extremely normal l find it. . .

289
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,889
. . .that you two. . .

290
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,287
. . .are together.

291
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,729
And that one day
you might get married. . .

292
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,691
. . .and have children of your own.

293
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:17,564
-Dude, are you okay?
-Totally.

294
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:20,852
Ross, you don't seem okay.

295
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:24,363
l'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

296
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:31,243
l think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

297
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,924
Wait, Ross. Ross, l--
l have to take off.

298
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,771
-No!
-l'm sorry.

299
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,242
l have an early class in the morning.

300
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:43,008
But this has been lovely.

301
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:47,612
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

302
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:50,048
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

303
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:55,211
You are on fire!
l'll call you in the morning, okay?

304
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,965
-Okay.
-All right.

305
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,049
God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just--

306
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,528
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

307
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,045
Fine.

308
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,722
Okay. l guess it's just flan for three.

309
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,564
Hey, that rhymes.

310
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,770
You know what, Ross,
l think we're gonna take off too.

311
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,610
Of course. God, l'm so stupid.

312
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,252
You guys are a couple now.

313
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:30,768
l mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

314
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:34,443
-No, it's just getting late--
-lt's fine. lt's totally fine.

315
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,446
l've got plenty of margaritas.
lt's all good.

316
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,087
l don't even know what that's for.

317
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,886
You know what?

318
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,085
l think l'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

319
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:59,285
-That's probably a good idea.
-l'll see you in the morning.

320
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:00,886
Okay.

321
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,089
Yeah, you know, Joey, l--

322
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:06,609
l don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

323
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,929
lt doesn't look good, does it?

324
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,492
Morning.

325
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,207
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

326
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:36,168
-Did you stay here all night?
-Yeah.

327
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:40,645
So you took off my pants and shoes?

328
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,366
No. No, no.

329
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:46,492
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the <i>Chicago</i> soundtrack.

330
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,525
Look, Ross. . .

331
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:55,003
. . .about Rachel and l. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that. . .

332
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,368
. . .because nothing's gonna happen.

333
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,803
What do you mean?

334
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:01,931
She and l said from the beginning. . .

335
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:04,891
. . .we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

336
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:06,486
And clearly--

337
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,287
What are you talking about?

l'm crazy about her.

355
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,406
And she feels the same way?

356
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,284
l think so.

357
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,205
Well, then. . .

358
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,648
. . .maybe it's time
we all moved on.

359
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,641
Yeah, but, Ross, l mean,
you're not okay with it, so--

00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,247
-She didn't see the dance, did she?
-No, no, no.

We just want to give
you a heads up.

00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,804
Bill and Colleen hate us.

374
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,288
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

375
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:33,806
What?

376
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,810
Still, he had to find out sometime.

377
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:39,966
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

378
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,601
l'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
