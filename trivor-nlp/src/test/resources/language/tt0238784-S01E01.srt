1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,548
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,509
Don't move, please.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,970
Why are you insisting on doing this?

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,140
Because you're starting
private school tomorrow.

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,602
Yes, but I'm gonna be wearing shoes.
Nobody's gonna see my feet.

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,105
Okay, but everybody knows
that private school girls are bad.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,025
And bad girls always wear red nail polish.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,196
Are you nervous?

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,823
- About what?
- About starting Chilton.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,244
I wasn't until I heard about
all those bad girls.

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,956
Guys! New CD!
XTC, Apple Venus Volume 2!

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,292
- Good!
- But you only finished half my toes.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,295
Who cares?
You're gonna be wearing shoes anyway!

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,243
Mom!

15
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,120
What? God! Hi.

16
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,081
- What are you doing?
- Having a heart attack.

17
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,417
I thought you were up. It's 7:10.

18
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,085
- What?
- It's 7:10.

19
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,128
No.

20
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,173
Stop it! It's 5:45.

21
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,175
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.

22
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,053
I set the clock for 5:45, so it's...

23
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,263
It's 7:10.

24
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,141
I can't be late on my first day of school.

25
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,977
You know what happens
when people are late on the first day?

26
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,062
It's shorter?

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,814
For the rest of the year
they're labeled 'The late girl. '

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,317
So dramatic. Where's the bathroom?

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,612
We have to go! What if there's traffic?

30
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,617
I had this all planned.
I was gonna get up early.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,079
I was gonna get coffee.
I was gonna take a shower.

32
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,582
I was gonna pick up my clothes
from the dry cleaner's.

33
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,462
- Oh, my God. My clothes.
- What?

34
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,507
- I don't have any clean clothes.
- It's 7:15.

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,343
- All my nice things were dirty.
- It's 7:16.

36
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,971
I was gonna wear my blue suit
with the flippy skirt.

37
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,890
- I look so great in the flippy skirt.
- It's 7:17.

38
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,433
You know what, time lady?

39
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,312
Go downstairs and warm up the car.
That would be really super. Thank you.

40
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,814
Just hurry!

41
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,024
This sucks!

42
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,986
- It's 7:18.
- For the love of God!

43
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,615
This is the last time I buy anything
just because it's furry!

44
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,493
It's 7...

45
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,246
Don't even think
of finishing that sentence.

46
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,956
What?

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,333
Nothing. I just didn't know
the rodeo was in town.

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,460
That's it. I'm bringing the baby pictures.

49
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,256
No! I'm sorry.
I love the rodeo, the rodeo rules.

50
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,262
- I remember it being smaller.
- Yeah. And less...

51
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,640
- Off with their heads.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,810
What are you looking at?

53
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,689
I'm just trying to see if there's
a hunchback up in that bell tower.

54
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,858
So, how do I look?

55
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,487
You look great.

56
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,489
- Really?
- Really.

57
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,076
You are an amazing kid.
You have earned this.

58
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,955
You just go in there
and show them what smart really is.

59
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,791
I love you. Call me if you need me.

60
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,461
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

61
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,799
Call me if you need anything.
I'm great at making up dirty cheers.

62
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,094
- You have to go in with me.
- Rory, come on.

63
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,388
You have to meet the headmaster.

64
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,975
Look at me. I can't meet anybody
who does anything in there.

65
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,186
No! I look like that chick
from The Dukes of Hazzard.

66
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,105
This is my first day.

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,483
You are not getting out of
going in there with me. Period.

68
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,991
Good morning.

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,245
We're gonna be best friends.

70
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,790
- So, where do we go?
- The Ambroise building.

71
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,210
- Which is?
- The big, scary one.

72
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,797
Great! Thanks for the input.

73
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,633
- Lost?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,095
We're looking for the headmaster's office,
Ambroise building.

75
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,472
Okay. This is it right here.

76
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,559
Just go inside, down the stairs,
make a left...

77
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,312
and the headmaster's office
is at the end of the hall.

78
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,564
- Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,151
I'm Ian Jack.
My daughter Julia goes to school here.

80
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,071
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
This is my daughter, Rory.

81
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,450
- Your daughter? Really?
- Yep.

82
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,160
Wow, that's great.

83
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,079
I mean, daughters are a great thing.

84
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,998
- We're big fans.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,628
Is your husband here?
I'd love to meet him.

86
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,254
I'm not married.

87
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,298
I'd love to meet your wife.

88
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,008
- I'm divorced.
- Shame.

89
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
- Excuse me. I really got to...
- Right.

90
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,888
We gotta go meet the big guy,
and I gotta get back to work.

91
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,973
- Where do you work?
- At an inn.

92
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,644
- The Independence Inn. I run it.
- Really?

93
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,813
In a different outfit, of course.

94
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,400
It was nice to meet you, Lorelai.
Good luck in school, Rory.

95
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,278
- I'll tell Julia to look out for you.
- Great, thanks.

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,613
See you.

97
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,700
What a nice man.

98
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,120
You're feeling pretty good
about yourself right now, aren't you?

99
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,372
Yeah.

100
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,834
- Do you want me to get you a mirror?
- I'm back. Let's go.

101
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,174
Good. More big stuff.

102
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,583
- You ready?
- No.

103
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,045
- You ready?
- Yes.

104
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,806
Excuse me.

105
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,852
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

106
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,647
This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore,
because I named her after me.

107
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,193
I was in the hospital, all whacked out
on Demerol. Never mind.

108
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,779
But we call her Rory.
It's short for Lorelai...

109
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,200
but she'll answer to either one
or even 'Hey, you' depending on...

110
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,160
Is the headmaster here?

111
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,703
One moment.

112
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,172
See, that's what happens
when you go to bed with your makeup on.

113
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,136
Headmaster Charleston will see you now.

114
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,972
Great. Thanks.

115
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,893
Ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.

116
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,562
Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet...

117
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,856
Mom.

118
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,487
What are you doing here?

119
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,990
I came to wish my granddaughter luck
on her first day of school.

120
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,701
Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform.

121
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,246
You didn't have to come all the way
out here, Mom.

122
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,124
This gave me a chance to make sure
that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.

123
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,502
- You're Hanlin.
- Hanlin Charleston.

124
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,089
Hanlin's wife and I are on the Symphony
Fundraising Committee together.

125
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,549
Wow. That's great.

126
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,425
Your father and I are golf rivals.

127
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,136
We're still fighting it out
to see which one is worse.

128
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,222
Oh, yes. We're all old friends.

129
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,474
Well, there's nothing like friends.

130
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,435
Especially if they're old... ones.

131
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,523
Would you like to take off your coat
and have a seat?

132
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,483
No, I'm fine.

133
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,611
They were a little overzealous
with the furnace this morning.

134
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,322
- It's quite warm in here.
- I like it warm.

135
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,241
Take off your coat and sit down.

136
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,827
You don't want Hanlin
to think you're rude.

137
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,298
Laundry day.

138
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,638
Hanlin, did you know
that Rory has a 4.0 grade average?

139
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,223
I'm sure he does, Mom.

140
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,976
This is a very special girl.
You take good care of her.

141
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,519
We'll do our best, Emily.

142
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,771
Oh, God. Rory's not going to be a problem.

143
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,816
She's totally low maintenance.
You know, like a Honda.

144
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,194
You know, they're just easy...

145
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,947
Nice office.

146
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,992
I don't think we should take up
any more of your precious time.

147
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,162
Hanlin, it was lovely to see you.
Give Bitty our love.

148
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,623
Tell Richard I'll see him
at the club Sunday.

149
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,792
Have a wonderful day, Rory.
I want to hear all about it.

150
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,837
Do you need a ride,
or is your horse parked outside?

151
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,508
It's so nice to meet you.

152
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,676
Have a great day.

153
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,472
You don't want to forget your coat.

154
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,600
No, 'cause that would be embarrassing.

155
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,816
How do you leave the house
looking like that?

156
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,360
It was not planned, believe me.

157
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,903
And on Rory's first day of school.

158
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,197
What kind of impression
did you think you'd make?

159
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,448
What are you doing here?

160
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,909
I told you,
I came to put in a good word for Rory.

161
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,120
- She didn't need a good word.
- I'm not allowed here, is that it?

162
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,330
I didn't say that.

163
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,999
I'm allowed to pay,
but I can't set foot on the premises.

164
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,252
- I want to get the rules straight.
- Oh, boy.

165
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,838
- How about driving down the street?
- Forget it.

166
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,340
Maybe I should avoid
this neighborhood altogether.

167
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,217
Though my doctor is down the block.

168
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,178
Maybe I'll get special permission
if I'm bleeding from the head.

169
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,765
I'm sorry.
I was just surprised to see you here.

170
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,978
I thought it was important for this school
to know they had a Gilmore with them.

171
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,437
A very good thought.

172
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,815
And that some of the Gilmores
actually own clothing.

173
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,985
And on that note, I have to get to work.
I'll see you later.

174
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,779
Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,619
You're obviously a bright girl,
Miss Gilmore.

176
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,831
- Thank you.
- Good grades, the teachers like you.

177
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,625
Not a lot of social activities, though.

178
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,171
Just living at Stars Hollow
is a social activity, actually.

179
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,173
Nothing in your school appealed to you?

180
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,009
I work at my mother's inn
after school sometimes.

181
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,596
I was in the German Club for a while.
But there were only three of us.

182
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,433
Then two left for the French Club
after seeing Schindler's List.

183
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,435
What are your aspirations?

184
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,771
I want to go to Harvard
to study Journalism and Political Science.

185
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,649
- On your way to being...
- Christiane Amanpour.

186
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,193
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,737
- Not Cokie Roberts?
- No.

188
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,532
Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women
from The View?

189
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,159
No.

190
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,078
Why do you wish
to be Christiane Amanpour?

191
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,456
I don't wish to be her exactly.

192
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,083
- I just want to do what she does.
- Which is?

193
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,213
Travel, see the world up close...

194
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:38,091
report on what's really going on,
be part of something big.

195
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,261
And to be a part of something big
you have to be on TV?

196
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,347
Why not lead the police
on a high-speed chase?

197
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,307
That's a quicker way to achieve this goal.

198
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,226
Being on TV has nothing to do with it.

199
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,313
Maybe I'll be a journalist and write books
or articles about what I see.

200
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:55,150
I just want to be sure
that I see... something.

201
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,407
You'll notice the debating team's
also missing from my resume.

202
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,204
I've known your grandparents
for quite some time.

203
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,455
I know.

204
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,959
In fact, I was at a party
at their house just last week...

205
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,379
where I had the most delicious
lobster puffs I've ever eaten.

206
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,464
I'm very fond of them.

207
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,258
That's nice.

208
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,636
None of this, however,
will be of any benefit to you.

209
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,055
Chilton has one of
the highest academic standards...

210
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,849
of any school in America.

211
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,393
You may have been the smartest girl
at Stars Hollow...

212
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,061
but this is a different place.

213
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,438
Pressures are greater,
the rules are stricter...

214
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,440
and the expectations are higher.

215
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,608
If you make it through...

216
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,611
you'll have received
one of the finest educations one can get.

217
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,115
And there should be no reason
why you should not achieve all your goals.

218
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,950
However, since you are starting late...

219
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,578
and are not used
to this highly competitive atmosphere...

220
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,080
there is a good chance you will fail.

221
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,126
That is fine. Failure is a part of life.

222
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,045
But not a part of Chilton.

223
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,131
Understand?

224
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,802
So, you liked the lobster puffs?

225
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,934
Take this to Miss James
in the administration office across the hall.

226
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,245
Hi, I'm looking for Miss James.

227
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,207
- Name?
- Lorelai Gilmore.

228
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,044
- But I go by Rory.
- Fill this out, please.

229
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,934
- Well?
- Shut up.

230
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,435
Hurry please. Spiders.

231
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,604
- Lorelai Gilmore.
- Nice stripper name.

232
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,065
- Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.
- Where's that?

233
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,984
Drive west, make a left at the haystacks,
and follow the cows.

234
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,402
A Dixie chick.

235
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,488
Perfect attendance,
4.0 grade point average.

236
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,739
Bugs, dirt, twigs.

237
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,074
She's a Journalism major.

238
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,409
That means she's going out
for the school paper.

239
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,828
Not necessarily.

240
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,871
She's got a thousand recommendations
in here.

241
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,457
Popular with the adults.
Going out for the school paper.

242
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,334
Will you stop? You don't know that.

243
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,669
- Something's biting me.
- Quiet.

244
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,753
I hate nature.

245
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,713
She'll never catch up.
She's a month behind.

246
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,383
- You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.
- You're funny.

247
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,051
Okay, lizard, goodbye.

248
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,512
Why are they letting
these extra people in?

249
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,722
They just take up space
and screw up the curve.

250
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,683
We don't need any new kids here.

251
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,017
Too late.

252
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,439
Here's the dining room, the science hall,
and the theater.

253
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,568
Here's your locker number,
here's your schedule, take this map.

254
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,612
Here's the rules of the school
and the Chilton Honor Code.

255
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:49,157
Here are the words to the school song
which must be recited upon demand.

256
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,159
This can happen any place, any time.

257
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:55,038
If you do it in Latin, you get extra credit.
Do you have any questions?

258
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,666
- Not at the moment.
- Lf you do, make an appointment...

259
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,668
to see your guidance counselor,
Mr. Winters.

260
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,045
He handles everything
but bulimia and pregnancy.

261
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,465
For that, you have to go to the nurse
or Coach Rubens.

262
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,259
Welcome to Chilton.

263
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,313
I already had the longest day of my life,
and it's only 10:00. How nice.

264
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,981
- There's no coffee.
- That's not funny.

265
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,316
I can give you herbal tea.

266
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,235
This is not an herbal tea morning.
This is a coffee morning.

267
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,404
Every morning for you is a coffee morning.

268
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,240
This is a jumbo coffee morning.
I need coffee in an I.V.

269
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,992
I can give you tea and a Balance Bar.

270
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,077
Please, please tell me you're kidding.

271
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,163
- I'm kidding.
- You're sick.

272
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,874
- Yep.
- You're a sadist. You're a fiend!

273
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,958
You're pretty.

274
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,752
- For here or to go?
- To go please.

275
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,338
Want to know what this does
to your nervous system?

276
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,341
- Do you have a chart? I love charts.
- Forget it, kill yourself.

277
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,302
So, what happened this morning
that was so awful?

278
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,846
- Rory started Chilton.
- Really?

279
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,264
Yeah.

280
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,391
What?

281
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,561
That's how you dressed to go to Chilton?
That's a fancy school.

282
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,565
My clothes were at the cleaners,
and my fuzzy clock didn't purr on time.

283
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,401
- It didn't purr?
- It's fuzzy. It purrs.

284
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,570
You know what. Never mind. I gotta go.

285
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,491
- I had a plan, damn it.
- Me, too. Next time you're getting tea.

286
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,833
Visualize, ladies.

287
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,043
It's a Thanksgiving Day parade.

288
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,753
You're standing on Fifth Avenue.

289
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,757
There's 100 beautiful boys
marching in place behind you.

290
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,092
And there you are.

291
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,596
You are in front with your fabulous legs
and your perfect tush.

292
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:38,392
Your baton is on fire,
and the crowd goes nuts!

293
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,769
Okay, cookie time.

294
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,356
- Lorelai, hi.
- Hey, Patty.

295
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,775
Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton?

296
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,653
Yeah, she's there now.
I just got through dropping her off.

297
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,113
Is that what you wore?

298
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,866
- Look at the time. See you, Patty.
- Bye.

299
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,245
Ladies, what do I see? Naked girls.

300
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:02,207
No, no, keep those leotards on.
This is not Brazil.

301
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,169
- Hello?
- Lorelai?

302
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:48,712
Mom?

303
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,256
Lorelai, good. I'm going shopping
this afternoon.

304
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,300
I thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory.

305
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,637
- Like what?
- A couple of skirts and tops for school.

306
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,849
I already took care of all that, Mom.
I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops.

307
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,768
But there are five days in a school week.

308
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,647
Really? Because my days-of-the-week
underwear only go to Thursday.

309
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,899
- Is that a joke?
- Mom, two skirts are fine.

310
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,610
- I never know with you.
- Really, don't bother.

311
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,320
What if she gets one dirty?

312
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,365
- She'll wear the other one.
- What if she gets them both dirty?

313
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,034
We'll use this newfangled thing
called a washing machine.

314
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,578
The town chipped in and bought one.
My turn's Tuesday.

315
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:25,040
Then, what about socks?
Chilton has these special logo socks.

316
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,834
- Rory should have them.
- Mom, please.

317
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,253
What about the school sweater?
She might like that.

318
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,505
There's a sweater vest and a book bag.

319
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,423
Are you getting a cut
of the merchandising?

320
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,134
Rory should have these.
She'll be the only one who doesn't.

321
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,678
She'll live.

322
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,472
I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat.
Is she a size 6?

323
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,140
Mom, please.

324
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,434
This is a simple question, Lorelai.

325
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,729
She's a 6,
but I'd get an 8 in case she grows.

326
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,398
If she grows, I'll buy another.

327
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,484
Okay, then a 6 is great.
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

328
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:57,656
While French culture was the dominant
outside cultural influence...

329
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,867
especially for Russia's moneyed class...

330
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,244
English culture also had its impact.

331
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,788
Tolstoy's favorite author,
for instance, was...

332
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:05,873
Dickens.

333
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:10,460
Yes. And of course, last week we covered
Dostoyevsky's main authorial influences...

334
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,714
- George Sand and Balzac.
- Good.

335
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,676
As Tolstoy commenced writing
War and Peace and Anna Karenina...

336
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,470
- Count Leo would turn to...
- David Copperfield.

337
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,849
Correct. He would turn
to David Copperfield for inspiration.

338
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,394
- Mr. Dugray.
- Sir.

339
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,354
Nice to have you back.

340
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,940
- I hope your grandfather's better.
- Much better, sir.

341
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,942
Good. Take your seat, please.

342
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,072
Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities,
Little Dorrit...

343
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,534
all major influences on Leo Tolstoy.

344
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,244
Tomorrow...

345
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,205
- Who's that?
- New girl.

346
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,083
...writing styles of these
two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens.

347
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,586
Class dismissed.

348
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,382
Looks like we got ourselves a Mary.

349
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,094
Miss Gilmore, come up here, please.

350
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,474
Here are last week's study materials.

351
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,310
There'll be a test on them tomorrow.
But since you're new...

352
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,480
you can take a makeup on Monday.
Will that be sufficient time?

353
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,732
Monday? Sure, that's fine.

354
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,609
Good. That's just an overview.

355
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,529
It'd be helpful to borrow
another student's personal notes.

356
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,572
They tend to be more detailed.

357
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,741
More detailed than this?

358
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,868
It seems daunting right now, I know.

359
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,746
No. It's okay. It'll be fine.

360
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,375
Remember to get those notes.
They'll be a lifesaver.

361
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,045
I'm Paris.

362
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,214
I didn't see you there.
Where'd you come from?

363
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,841
I know who you are, too.

364
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,260
Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow.

365
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,719
You can call me Rory.

366
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,013
- Are you going out for The Franklin?
- The what?

367
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,223
Nice innocent act.

368
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,600
At least I know
you're not going out for Drama Club.

369
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:49,852
I'm confused.

370
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,146
The Franklin, the school paper,
are you going out for it?

371
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,315
I don't know. I have to find my locker first.

372
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,360
- I'm gonna be editor next year.
- Good for you.

373
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,695
I'm also the top of the class.

374
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,239
I intend to be valedictorian
when I graduate.

375
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,782
Okay. I'm going now.

376
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,285
You'll never catch up.
You'll never beat me.

377
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,454
This school is my domain,
and The Franklin is my domain.

378
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,623
Don't you ever forget that.

379
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,880
I guess you're not
going to let me borrow your notes.

380
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,599
They're smaller than the last batch.

381
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,267
No, they're not.

382
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,020
Smaller means watery.
No good peach taste.

383
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,855
No, there's plenty of peach taste...

384
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,441
being as they're, you know, peaches.

385
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,694
- What about the ones on the bottom?
- Great.

386
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,864
No. Be sure to check them all. That's it.

387
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,450
Give every last one of them
a nice, good squeeze.

388
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,912
You wouldn't want to leave me one
that I could sell to somebody else.

389
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,123
Wait a minute, you missed one.
I won't tell you which one it is.

390
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:57,336
I'm just going to let your impeccably
good radar... There it is, you got it.

391
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,462
Okay.

392
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,590
- I look great, right?
- Yes.

393
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,343
Yes, see. This is how I was supposed
to look this morning.

394
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,262
- Morning, Jackson.
- Oh, my God, today was Rory's first day.

395
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,598
Yes. I was supposed
to look together and fabulous.

396
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,558
Not like I was playing quarters all night.

397
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,019
- Nobody cares how you looked.
- Everybody cared.

398
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,688
- Who?
- The other moms, the headmaster.

399
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:20,901
My mom, Luke, Miss Patty,
the new fire chief with the tiny little head.

400
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,778
Taste this.

401
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,781
A little watery.

402
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,574
Now, you planned this.

403
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,369
- Did you say something about your mom?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:33,288
I walked into the headmaster's office,
and there she was.

405
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,373
Really? Why?

406
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,252
Because she knew I'd wake up late,
dress like a cowgirl, and humiliate myself.

407
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,712
- Wow, she's good.
- She's the best.

408
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,298
I would love to know what you're doing.

409
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,301
- They're rolling differently, too.
- Because of the extra water.

410
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,595
- Exactly.
- Makes perfect sense.

411
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,514
I would ignore those women...

412
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,226
because the only thing that matters
is that Rory got into that great school.

413
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,313
I know. She looked so amazing
in her uniform, and she was so excited.

414
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:01,650
I just admire her so much,
jumping into a new school.

415
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,443
- She's my hero.
- Mine, too.

416
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,028
Yeah. Sign me up.

417
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,239
Sookie, the peaches, please.

418
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,618
Excuse me. There's a phone call for you...

419
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,455
and if I'm to fetch you like a dog,
I'd like a cookie and a raise.

420
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,332
Thanks for the peach.

421
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,963
This will be absolutely wonderful.

422
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:26,258
There are supposed to be darling shops
all up and down this street.

423
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:30,220
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me
where we can find the best antiques?

424
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,264
At your house, I'd guess.

425
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,602
Mom, did I give you this number,
'cause I don't remember doing that.

426
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,354
Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind.
What can I...

427
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,899
I'm sorry, Mom,
can you hold on one second?

428
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,110
Drella, could you take it down
just a notch?

429
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,696
Thanks. Okay, I'm back.

430
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,575
I wanted you to know that I just bought
a parking space for Rory at Chilton.

431
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,328
- You what?
- They are very hard to come by.

432
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,081
- But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers.
- Mom, Rory doesn't have a car.

433
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,083
No, but she's got a birthday
coming up soon.

434
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,085
Okay, hold on a second.

435
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,507
Drella, please, a little softer.

436
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,551
Do I look like I got Panasonic
stamped on my ass?

437
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,055
Mom, you are not buying Rory a car.

438
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,432
Why not? She's a smart girl.
She's responsible.

439
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:18,393
- She doesn't need one.
- She needs to have a way to get around.

440
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,437
- To get to school.
- She'll be taking the bus.

441
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,272
I know. I hate that she takes the bus.

442
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,774
Drug dealers take the bus.

443
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,484
You know what, Mom? I gotta go.

444
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,903
Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date.

445
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,279
Okay. Bye.

446
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,496
Mary.

447
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,582
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

448
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,085
- My name is Rory.
- I'm Tristan.

449
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,795
- Hi.
- So you new?

450
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,965
- Yeah, first day.
- Remmy's class is rough.

451
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,967
Yeah, it seemed very intense.

452
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,553
I could loan you my notes,
if that would help.

453
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,930
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah?

454
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,516
How great?

455
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,309
I don't know.

456
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,062
Mr. Remmy said that
getting someone's notes would be...

457
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,857
I could even help you study if you want.

458
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,319
I kind of view studying
as a solitary activity.

459
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,113
But thanks.

460
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,574
Bye, Mary.

461
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,285
It's Rory.

462
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,417
- I completely understand.
- Do you? Because this is a brand-new car.

463
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,086
- But I swear.
- He brings the car up and it's scratched.

464
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,504
I just backed the car up and...

465
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,716
I'd know if my car was scratched
before I parked it or not.

466
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,384
Let's calm down.

467
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,095
Sir, why don't I have your car
looked at tomorrow?

468
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,140
- I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this.
- No.

469
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:42,060
In the meantime, I would love for you
to have lunch here on me.

470
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,478
Dessert is a must.

471
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:46,398
Anything with our homemade ice cream
is absolutely delicious.

472
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:50,402
I promise, life as you know it,
will never be the same. What do you say?

473
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,863
I think I will.

474
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,865
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

475
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,702
- Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car.
- Derek.

476
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,788
I mean, if you thought I was unreliable
or a bad driver...

477
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,123
It's okay.

478
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,375
'Cause I can drive.

479
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,669
Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can.

480
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,881
We'll take it to Musky's tomorrow
and have the guys look at it.

481
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,717
I'm sure they can buff it out
for nothing. Okay?

482
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,968
Okay.

483
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,723
That's a real nice outfit
you're wearing today.

484
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,391
Thank you, Derek.

485
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,189
Once again, your faithful pooch
is here to say:

486
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,900
'Please come to the desk.
Someone needs to talk to you. '

487
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,402
- It's not my mother, is it?
- It's possible.

488
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,239
- It's possible?
- There's a resemblance.

489
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,867
- Hi.
- Hi. Is this a bad time?

490
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,286
No, not at all. What are you doing here?

491
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,540
I had to meet an associate for lunch.
He was coming from New York.

492
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,209
So I thought,
'Why not meet him in a beautiful inn? '

493
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,628
- Good. Enjoy your lunch.
- Thanks. I will.

494
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,089
- Okay.
- And I was also wondering...

495
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,633
if maybe I could take you out
to dinner sometime.

496
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,135
We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we?

497
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,264
It's the company more than the food
that interests me.

498
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,516
- I'm flattered.
- Is that a yes?

499
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,893
That's a... you're a dad.

500
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,520
And you're a mom.

501
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,940
Although I'm still finding that
really hard to believe.

502
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,401
No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad.

503
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,029
- That sounds bad.
- Not bad. Just tricky.

504
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,157
You know, Rory just started there...

505
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,659
and I should let her fall in
with the bad crowd...

506
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,786
before I start hooking up with the PTA.

507
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,037
I'm not on the PTA.

508
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,999
See? There you go,
I can't date anyone not on the PTA.

509
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,668
- It's just a casual dinner.
- Sorry.

510
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:37,843
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to China for a week on business.

511
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,137
When I get back, I'm going to try again.

512
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,889
China? Wow.

513
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,932
- Impressed?
- No.

514
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,769
Rome, I'd be impressed.
China, I'm just, 'China? Wow. '

515
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:54,193
'Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager. '
I'll talk to you soon.

516
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,653
- Have a safe trip.
- I will.

517
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,537
- He does that so well.
- You are making me sick.

518
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,333
Now, honey. You try it.
I'll watch you walk away, too.

519
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,418
- Stop it.
- Go on now, walk.

520
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:14,129
- It can't be that bad.
- Leave me alone.

521
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,007
No. You have to do it
with a little more attitude.

522
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,092
Make me think you mean it.

523
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,900
That's lunch.

524
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,548
I'm sorry, but you're going to open.

525
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:06,306
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

526
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,517
Paris, please, I'm so sorry.

527
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,478
It was an accident.
My locker, it just slipped.

528
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:14,147
I pulled too hard. I didn't mean to...

529
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,817
Is there water in that moat?

530
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,527
Get away from me.

531
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,911
Excuse me, I need Ms. Ness. History?

532
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,538
It's behind you.

533
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,666
Of course it is.

534
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,382
You've got to be kidding me.

535
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,887
Seats now, please.

536
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:46,763
Hey, Mary.

537
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,683
Okay.

538
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,770
We left our projects off on Friday
with Mr. Gaynor...

539
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,315
so today we will pick up with Miss Geller.

540
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,444
I don't have my project.

541
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,822
Miss Geller, did you have sufficient time
to complete your project?

542
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,492
- Yes.
- And yet you don't have it done?

543
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:08,327
- No.
- All right.

544
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,829
You will receive an 'incomplete'
for this project.

545
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,789
- It's my fault.
- Who are you?

546
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:15,667
- Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project.
- Shut up.

547
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:19,880
I don't have a Rory Gilmore.
I have a Lorelai Gilmore.

548
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,048
That's me.

549
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,550
You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore?

550
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,345
Yes. And I wrecked her project.
My locker got stuck.

551
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,013
Just stay out of this.

552
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,807
- Do you go by Rory or Lorelai?
- Whatever.

553
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,601
It's not her fault.

554
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,937
- I need you to pick one.
- One what?

555
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,271
One name.

556
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,357
- Rory.
- Fine. Thank you.

557
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,736
You wrecked Paris' project when?

558
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,364
- Just before class.
- Very convenient.

559
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,492
No, I did. My locker got stuck,
and when I opened it...

560
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,576
Stop it!

561
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,287
Miss Gilmore, since you say
you wrecked her project...

562
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,456
then you may help her fix it.

563
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,500
You have until tomorrow.

564
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:57,876
- Fine.
- No.

565
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,962
- Why not?
- I don't want your help.

566
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,381
- But I don't mind doing it.
- Stay out of this.

567
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,799
What's wrong with you?

568
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,342
- I'm trying to help.
- Don't.

569
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,219
Ladies, enough.

570
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,682
If you don't want Miss Gilmore's help,
then you may have until tomorrow.

571
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:14,601
If it's not done,
you will receive an 'incomplete. '

572
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,395
Is that understood?

573
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:18,856
Yes.

574
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,277
As long as you're standing, class...

575
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,697
we have a new student.
Say hello to Rory Gilmore.

576
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,866
Hello, Mary.

577
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,043
Now, walk smooth.
That's the new Harry Potter on your heads.

578
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,589
If they should drop, Harry will die,
and there won't be any more books.

579
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,884
Now that's how you should've dressed
this morning, missy.

580
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,848
What are you doing here?

581
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,144
See now, that's why you were voted
Mr. Personality of the new millennium.

582
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:58,562
Where's your crown?

583
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:01,064
I just mean you don't usually come in
at this time.

584
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,609
I have to pick up Rory from school.

585
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

586
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,778
No lectures?

587
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,407
My blood sugar's low.
I'll eat an apple and get back to you.

588
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,495
God, this has been one hectic,
bizarre day for me.

589
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,704
Yeah?

590
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,790
This morning with the being late
and my mom with her existing.

591
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,751
And this father from Chilton.

592
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:24,713
He drove out to the Inn all the way
from Hartford just to ask me out.

593
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,715
Really? Are you going?

594
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,428
No. He's got a kid in school with Rory,
and the whole thing seemed a little weird.

595
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,889
- Good.
- Good?

596
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,185
Yeah, I think it's good
that you turned him down.

597
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,603
Okay.

598
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,105
- I mean, he's probably old, right?
- Old?

599
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,150
- Yeah, I mean, he has a kid in high school.
- Well, so do I.

600
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:48,195
You were young when you had Rory.
Most people aren't that young.

601
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,072
- Most people are...
- Old.

602
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,156
Yeah.

603
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,534
Like this guy who asked me out.

604
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,495
But you're not going.

605
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,331
No, I'm not going.

606
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,171
Oh, that's me.

607
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,260
Hello? Hi, Babbette.

608
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,972
What? Okay.

609
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,975
No, I'll be right there. Thanks.

610
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,936
I have to go.

611
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,605
Keep it. I gave you decaf.

612
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,331
Lorelai, I'm so sorry
I had to call you like this.

613
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,542
That's okay, Babbette. I appreciate it.

614
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:47,421
All of a sudden, they pull up, get out
of the truck, and start sniffing around.

615
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,882
- It's very strange.
- All right. Let me talk to them.

616
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,092
- Tell her about the gnome.
- They kicked a gnome.

617
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,510
- What?
- Right in the head.

618
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,680
- That's just not cool.
- I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?

619
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,932
He's fine, sugar. Thanks for asking.

620
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,684
But I wouldn't trust these boys.

621
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,729
Gnome kicking says a lot
about a man's character.

622
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:06,732
Yes. I'm gonna go
take care of this. Thanks.

623
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,739
What are you doing?

624
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,199
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

625
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:18,660
I'm supposed to install a DSL
for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?

626
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,204
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm Mick.

627
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,456
Nice to meet you.
Could you get off my porch?

628
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,626
I was told to look for a ceramic frog
with a key in it.

629
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,878
- I don't understand.
- We can't find the frog.

630
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:32,007
- I didn't order a DSL.
- The order was placed by Emily Gilmore.

631
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,634
No.

632
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,762
We would've been done,
but the frog search put us way behind.

633
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:37,930
Look.

634
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,349
- I found it.
- You found the frog.

635
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,060
- It was a turtle, not a frog.
- It says here it's a frog.

636
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,436
- It's a turtle.
- Really?

637
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,898
Trust me. Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel that DSL order.

638
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,399
Sure? It's already paid for.

639
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,860
Yeah, I know, but we don't need a DSL...

640
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,696
so thanks for coming,
and you guys can just go.

641
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,908
Is there a problem?

642
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,453
Nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn
into a really good play.

643
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:05,958
Let's try another passage.

644
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,045
'The Romanists have,
with great adroitness...

645
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,548
'drawn three walls round themselves...

646
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,926
'with which they have hitherto
protected themselves...

647
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:20,722
'so that no one could reform them,
whereby Christendom has fallen terribly. '

648
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,685
- Who said this?
- Martin Luther.

649
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,062
Very good, Miss Gilmore.

650
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,524
And what year did Martin Luther
address the Christian nobility?

651
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,068
- 1520.
- Very good, Miss Gilmore.

652
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,321
Until next time, class.

653
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,413
Stay out of my way.

654
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,541
I will make this school a living hell for you.

655
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,004
See you tomorrow, Mary.

656
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,840
The name is Rory.

657
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,228
- Can I help you?
- God, I wish.

658
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,982
What on earth...

659
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:16,236
- You're not buying us a DSL.
- Lorelai, this is hardly the place.

660
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,530
I canceled the order,
and it's not happening.

661
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,616
But Rory needs the Internet for her school.

662
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:21,909
We have the Internet.

663
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,703
- This is faster.
- We like our Internet slow, okay?

664
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:28,040
We can turn it on, walk around,
do a little dance, make a sandwich.

665
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,210
With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking,
and we'd starve.

666
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,004
It'd be all work and no play.
Haven't you seen The Shining?

667
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,672
What on earth are you talking about?

668
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:38,217
Also, there will be no cars,
no parking spaces.

669
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:41,178
And all the uniforms
will be supplied by me. The mother.

670
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,222
That's final. There will be no discussion.

671
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:46,767
- You're being stubborn as usual.
- No, I'm not being stubborn as usual.

672
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,018
I'm being me.

673
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,188
The same person who always needed
to work out her own problems...

674
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,066
and take care of herself,
because that's the way I was born.

675
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,902
- That's how I am!
- Florence, I'm dripping.

676
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,739
I appreciate what you have done for Rory
in paying for her school.

677
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,450
That will not be forgotten. You won't let it.

678
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,744
But she is my daughter.

679
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,622
And I decide how we live, not you.

680
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,211
Now then...

681
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,422
do they validate parking here?

682
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,050
There's a stamp at the desk.

683
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,928
Thank you.

684
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,197
Hey, you.

685
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:48,495
So, this whole plaid-skirt thing, my idea?

686
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,497
My day sucked, too.

687
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,833
- Promise?
- I swear on my mother's life.

688
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,210
- Not yet.
- Still hugging.

689
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,381
- So, I brought us some coffee.
- Why, I'm shocked.

690
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,049
Triple caps, easy foam.

691
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:04,386
If that doesn't work,
we'll stick our fingers in a light socket.

692
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,804
Come here.

693
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,767
Wow, what, do they expect you
to get smart all in one day?

694
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,687
- They expect a lot of things.
- So, tell me.

695
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,024
I don't know. It was just one big, long...

696
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:20,402
scary, tweedy, bad eight hours.

697
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,280
Add some hair spray,
and you've got my day.

698
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,533
One of the girls already hates me.
The guys are weird.

699
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,453
- Weirder than other guys?
- Yeah, they kept calling me Mary.

700
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,704
You're kidding me.

701
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:34,041
Wow, I can't believe they still say that.

702
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,920
- Why? What does it mean?
- Mary, like Virgin Mary.

703
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,380
It means they think
you look like a goody-goody.

704
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,090
- You're kidding.
- No.

705
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,511
What would they have called me
if they thought I looked like a slut?

706
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,930
They might have added a Magdalene to it.

707
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,475
Biblical insults.
This is an advanced school.

708
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,900
It was so weird
not having you in school today.

709
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,402
I mean, I finally noticed
some of the other kids.

710
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,905
Let me just say, they are a sad lot.

711
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:08,909
Yeah? Add a couple plaid skirts,
and you've got the Chilton freaks.

712
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,537
- I totally miss you.
- I miss you.

713
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,206
Guys, I have an idea.

714
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,166
What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays...

715
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,252
when I go to Hartford
for my business class...

716
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,171
what if Lane comes along,
and you guys can shop and study...

717
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,965
and join a cult and shave your heads?

718
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,093
- Really?
- All except the shaving your heads part.

719
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,470
Oh, no. What time is it?

720
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:30,597
6:30.

721
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,683
- I'm late for dinner.
- Again?

722
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:36,854
Lane, your mother is gonna kill me
if I keep sending you home fed and happy.

723
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,482
I'm sorry. But she found a website
that sells tofu in bulk.

724
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:41,859
You're kidding, right?

725
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,486
Yesterday, she went out
and bought a bigger fridge.

726
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,572
Boy, honey, your life is scary.

727
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:49,158
- Can I have your crust?
- It's the least I can do.

728
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,617
Thanks. Bye.

729
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:04,298
A pizza for your thoughts.

730
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,593
I wish I could figure out a way
to get Paris off my back.

731
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,053
Yeah, angry chicks are the worst.

732
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,348
When I was in high school, I had a Paris.

733
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,517
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she was horrible.

734
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,937
- How'd you get rid of her?
- I got pregnant and dropped out.

735
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,107
- What if I learn to French braid her hair?
- Even better.

736
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,235
Sweetie, you can't let those kids
get you down.

737
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,487
I know.

738
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,363
Do you want me to talk to anybody?

739
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,283
A parent, a teacher,
a big guy named Moose?

740
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:34,244
- I'll just figure it out for myself.
- Okay.

741
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,165
What?

742
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,709
I was thinking
about the way Paris' face looked...

743
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,086
when I beat her
to that Martin Luther question.

744
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,297
- Good?
- Fourteen shades of purple.

745
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,883
- Cool.
- Tomorrow I'm shooting for 15.

746
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,803
What do you think of Luke?

747
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,015
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do you think he's cute?

748
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,060
- No. No way.
- No way, what?

749
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:01,021
- You cannot date Luke.
- I said nothing about dating Luke.

750
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,733
If you date him, you'll break up
and we'll never be able to eat there again.

751
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,486
I repeat, I said nothing about dating Luke.

752
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,614
Date Al from Pancake World,
his food stinks.

753
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,533
I cannot believe what I'm hearing.

754
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:15,494
Al's food does not stink, Al stinks.
